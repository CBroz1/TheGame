# Changelog

## General

Deck of Adventures adopts conventions outlined by
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/): Major:Minor:Patch. As much of this convention
is specific to software development, we make the following general adjustments.

1. MAJOR versions are for significant changes that may not be backwards compatible. 
2. MINOR versions add new features that are backwards compatible. 
3. PATCH versions are backwards compatible adjustments to central governing documents.

While untracked edits may change individual pages and patches may systematically change
multiple pages, minor and major versions will be accompanied by descriptors detailing
the nature of these changes.
