## Section 1: Introduction

<!-- Commenting out the below and considering keeping GM Guide 'Lore-less' --> 

<!-- 
> You’ve entered the world of Pelagia as a player, and realized you wanted to
  become a Storyteller, one of the most important parts of Pelagia. This is how
  our voices spread through the heavens. Once known as “Beedle Bards,”
  Storytellers have taken shape all throughout the known Cosmiverse.
> Respected and honored, Storytellers are welcome at every hearth and home,
  every tavern and table, for the joyful company they bring. They tell of
  adventures, and entertain those around them by allowing them to live, for a
  time, within those adventures. Storytellers are known wide and far for their
  ability, some even call it Magic, to weave a story between multiple listeners
  and spectators and for them to feel they have lived those adventures for
  themselves.
> This is the magic you might wield, oh reader. Guides may lie ahead, but the
  true spirit must come from deep within you.

> Humbly,
> Duke Beedle of Pelagia

As the Game Master, your task is to bring together a group of Players and guide
them through an Adventure. An Adventure can last for a single 2-3 hour session,
or it can unfold over the course of weeks, months, or even years in a continous
narrative. You can bring together close friends in person, or find new friends
virtually through **MISSING** or in the Discord.

If you’ve been a Game Master elsewhere and are hoping to learn about what’s
different about being a Deck of Adventures Game Master, you can skip right to
Section 3, “Being a Deck of Adventures Game Master". For everyone else, or
those Game Masters who want a refresher, we’ll dive into what being a Game
Master is all about in Section 2: “Getting Started as a Game Master”. 

If you or your players have questions or need a helping hand, please reach out
to the team on [Discord] (https://discord.gg/tmHSdb3TRQ) or via GitHub issues.


## Section 2: Getting Started as a Game Master

Game Masters play referee and primary Storyteller in a Tabletop RPG like Deck of
Adventures. You are the arbiter of the rules, as well as the actor and
playwright who brings the various scenes of the story to life and voices the
majority of the characters who populate the world.

Game Masters are responsible for preparing materials ahead of sessions and
guiding a group of Players through a collaborative narrative in the form of an
Adventure. You bring the game to life for the Players at the table, and can
tell any type of story you would like. There is significant creative freedom in
being a Game Master, both with the types of stories you can tell, and the way
those stories unfold.  

In this Section, you will learn more about what being a Game Master entails in
Tabletop RPGs more generally, as well as the important things to keep in mind
when assuming this role. 

Game Masters come in all styles and each Game Master brings their unique
strengths and talents to the table. Don't compare yourself to others,
especially those with significant experience at the table. This is a craft that
takes years to hone, and decades to master, but you can be a great Game Master
within your first few sessions of play if you follow this guide. The Community
also is available to offer advice, drawing from years of collective Game Master
experience, to support new Game Masters. 

As a Game Master, you need to be prepared to spend time outside of normal
session hours working on your Adventure. A well-prepared Adventure makes
running a session far easier than if you try to 'wing it'. Improvisation and
sponenaeity are two vital ingredients to a great session of Deck of Adventures,
but having important things mapped out and planned ahead of time is important
for you as the Game Master. 

Sometimes, things you prepare ahead of time may not pan out perfectly, and that
is OK. The Players at the table each have their own creative agency, and the
actions and decisions of their characters are not predictable. When things
don't go to plan, don't force the players back into a prescribed narrative just
because you have that prepared. If the logical actions and outcomes of the
Players in the session lead to a different outcome, go with it. These will lead
to the most organic and well-remembered circumstances in your Adventure, and
Players and GM's work together to bring these moments to life. The Game Master
builds the world, populates it with characters and history, and then the
Players walk through that world and experience it first-hand.

## Section 4: Running a Session with Deck of Adventures

### The Target Card System

As a Game Master, you will set up various challenges and difficulties for the
Players throughout an Adventure. To resolve these challenges, a Player or GM
will draw a Target Card, and the opposing force makes a Check and draws a card.
The level of difficulty of a Check is set by the Difficulty Range, which is how
far away a pip value can be of the card being drawn relative to the value of
the Target Card. 

### Successes and Failures

- Successes are cards that are drawn with a pip value within the Diffulty Range.
  When a Check is successful, the character making the Check is able to
  accomplish what they were intending to do.
- Misses are cards that are drawn outside of the Difficulty Range. When a Check
  misses, the character making the Check is unable to accomplish what they were
  intending to do. 
- Critical Successes have a 1.9% chance of success. They should feel amazing for
  the Player. Make an effort to rewards these exact matches whenever you can
  with additional effects or bonuses.
- Major Successes have a 7.7% chance of success. This should still feel pretty
  good to your players. When drawn in Combat, a Major Success increases the
  damage of the attack. Make your out of combat bonuses feel just as good.
- Suited Successes occur when the card drawn falls within the Difficulty Range
  and matches the Suit of the Target Card. 
- A Player can use a Fate Card for a free re-draw, and if this turns a Miss into
  a Success you must ignore that there was a Miss. This is treated as a regular
  Success.


### Likelihood Chart

The chart below shows probability of success for the kinds of draws you will
typically encounter at each DR. Note that Color or Suit match divide the
likelihood by 2 and 4 respectively. The final row notes the difference caused
by drawing 2 cards at Upper or Lower Hand. At the ends, there isn't much of an
impact, but can increase or decrease the probability by as much as 25% for a DR
3 check.

| DR          | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6    |
|------------:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:| :---:| | Normal Draw | 8%
|23% | 38% | 54% | 69% | 85% | 100% | | Color Draw  | 4%  | 12% | 19% | 27% |
35% | 42% | 50%  | | Suit Draw   | 2%  | 6%  | 10% | 13% | 17% | 21% | 25%  | |
Lower Hand 2| 1%  | 5%  | 15% | 29% | 48% | 72% | 100% | | Upper Hand 2| 15% |
41% | 62% | 79% | 91% | 98% | 100% | | Difference  |  7% | 18% | 24% | 25% |
21% | 13% | NA   |

### Fate Cards

It's up to you to decide how often you want players to use their Fate Cards. By
default players start with their 2 Jokers and will randomly gain Fate Cards as
they draw their Aces. If you want to give them more chances to redraw, reward
key moments of play by giving a Player a Fate Card. This can be a great tool
for encouraging great roleplay or working together. 

### Skills breakdown

Players will want to make Checks based on their character's strengths. Their
approach to a situation should determine the nature of a check, but as the GM
you ultimately have the final say in which skill applies. Attributes are meant
to be more responsive/reactive, and are often used for Contested Checks. Skills
are intended to be more active for character-initiated events such as scaling a
wall or looking for something.

The below is a list of general information about the Attributes and Skills. More
information is available in the [Full Players Guide]
(https://github.com/DeckofAdventures/TheGame/blob/main/1_Mechanics/01_PlayerGuide_Full.md#Characters)

- AGL Agility: Dodging Contested Checks, boosts Unarmored AC
   - Finesse: Primary Skill for Martial
   - Stealth: how quietly you can move about
- CON Conviction: Resistance to harmful effects, strength of personality
   - Bluffing: how convincing you are, lying or truthful
   - Performance: success for activities in front of large audiences
- GUT Intuition: Inexplicable gut feelings (e.g., truthfulness, supernatural
  knowledge)
   - Detection: observing the world, taking in the surroundings using all of
     your senses
   - Craft: Primary Skill for Support, practicing a trade (Medicine, Pottery,
     Piety)
- INT Intelligence: Thinking on the fly, rapidly recalling information
   - Knowledge: Primary Skill for Casters, how much you know with regards to
     history or science
   - Investigation: Actively seeking the answer to a specific question using
     senses and acumen
- STR Strength: Physical limits and boundaries, useful in resisting a push or
  catching a boulder.
   - Athletics: Sustained exertion.
   - Brute: Primary Skill for Defenders, a burst hit or single heavy lift.
- VIT Vitality: Determines HP, resistance of disease.

### Contested checks

Contested Checks are initiated when two opposing forces are attempting to
accomplish something at the same time. This can be someone attempting to push
someone else over, a Player trying to convince an NPC that they are an ally, or
with the use of certain Powers. 

For the most updated reference and ruling on Contested Checks, visit the
[Full Player Guide]
(https://github.com/DeckofAdventures/TheGame/blob/main/1_Mechanics/01_PlayerGuide_Full.md#contested-checks)


Here are some Examples of Skills that are used in Contested Checks, though you
are free to decide what makes the most sense in a given scenario at your table.
1. Tackle Target: Attacker Finesse vs. Target Athletics 2. Convince Target,
truthfully: Bluffing vs. Target Detection 3. Convince Target, deceptively:
Bluffing vs. Target Detection


### Running Epic Events

Epic Events are unique, time-gated scenarios that can occur throughout an
Adventure. As the Game Master, you determine when an Epic Event will happen,
set the Difficulty, and decide the Stakes. 

#### How to Identify an Epic Event

Epic Events occur within a specific set amount of time, typically best for
anything that would unfold in less than a minute. They invoke a specific set of
rules for determining the outcome, which is different than traditional combat,
social interaction, or exploration. 

Setting an Epic Event during a session typically is a good way to engage all of
your players in a faster-paced, more free-form set of roleplaying. Since
Players can't make a Check two times in a row, it requires active dialogue,
planning, and participation from every Player. It is recommended to stick to
one or two Epic Events per session, so as to keep it feeling unique and not
drain too much Stamina from the Players, though as the Game Master you can set
as many as you would like. 

An Epic Event can be the group attempting to escape a crumbling fortress, or
escape an island with an erupting volcano. It can cover things that are smaller
in scope, such as a single point on a larger battlefield, or it can determine
the outcome of an entire battle itself. As the Game Master, you will get a feel
for what makes for a good Epic Event, and how to place it in your narrative to
keep the session feeling fresh and lively for all of your Players.

For the most updated reference on Epic Events, visit the [Full Player Guide]
(https://github.com/DeckofAdventures/TheGame/blob/main/1_Mechanics/01_PlayerGuide_Full.md#Epic-Events)

#### Setting an Epic Event's Difficulty

You determine the Difficulty of an Epic Event ahead of time and announce the
Difficulty at the beginning of the Epic Event. This is how many total Successes
will be needed to complete the Epic Event before 3 Failures. 

Setting an Epic Event with a Difficulty of 4 means that the Players need make 4
Successful Checks before reaching 3 Failures. The Game Master can modify this
difficulty or adjust the Stakes depending how many Failures there are before
reaching the number of Successes required.

#### Deciding the Stakes

The Stakes of an Epic Event are the outcomes of both Success and Failure for the
Players. Going into an Epic Event, there is no guarantee of Success, even at
lower Difficulties. It is highly recommended to ensure you have outcomes
correctly balanced and prepared for the scope of the Epic Event. Not all Epic
Events are life-or-death scenarios, and consequences can vary depending on the
degree of failure. 

If Players are trying to escape a building before it collapses, and they are
unsuccessful, they can each take a certain amount of damage or discard a number
of cards based on the number of successes before they failed. Likewise, if the
Players are successful without getting any failures, the reward for their
success can be balanced accordingly. 

<!-- MISSING - a table or reference of standard success/failures + example
 stakes for certain types of scenarios --> 

#### An Example of an Epic Event

The Players hear screaming in the distance, and rush to investigate. From 100
feet away, they can see a group of townsfolk being attacked by a group of
monsters. Each townsfolk is engaged with a different monster. The Difficulty is
set to 3, and 5 target cards are drawn. The Players then declare which skill
they will use to save one of the townsfolk, and must make a suited hit before
the GM does to succeed on each TC. 

- The Defender chooses to use Brute to intercede with one of the monsters and
  distract it while the Townsfolk gets away. The GM decides based on the skill
  chosen and the scenario what the DR would be, in this case choosing DR 3 on a
  Target Card of 9 of Hearts. The Defender has a +2 to Brute, and draws a 6 of
  Hearts. This is a success, since it is within the DR and matches the suit,
  and the townsfolk is able to escape safely. The Target Card is flipped over,
  marking one success. 

- The Support wants to protect a townsfolk using Craft, which they have a +1
  modifier. The GM rules this more difficult, making it a DR 2 on a TC of 7 of
  Clubs. The Support draws a 3 of Diamonds, which is a miss. The GM then draws,
  without a modifier, against this same TC. They draw a 6 of Spades. Also a
  miss. They go back and forth for a few more draws until the Support draws a 5
  of Clubs, which is a success. 

- The Martial wants to sneak up to a townsfolk and help them escape out from
  under the monster's grasp, intending to use Stealth which they have a +2 in.
  The GM rules this as moderately difficult, making it a DR 2 on a TC of Jack
  of Spades. The Martial draws first, and misses. The GM draws a King of
  Spades, which makes it the first failure for the Players.

- The Caster and Support both go for the fourth TC together, each with their
  primary skill modifier. The DR is set to a 3, and they each draw first,
  missing the TC. The GM draws, and misses. The Caster misses again, but uses a
  Fate Card to re-draw and draws a suited hit. This marks a 3rd success for the
  Players, which ends the Epic Event.

The Players watch as the monsters retreat, having saved the majority of the
townsfolk. Since there was a failure, one of the townsfolk has been gravely
injured and was dragged away with the monsters as they retreated. The Players
then can choose to follow after the monsters or regroup with the townsfolk they
saved, having successfully prevented more lives from being lost. This can
result in a reward from the local government for saving lives, or kick off a
new Adventure that involves seeking out the monsters in their lair and putting
a stop to them.
