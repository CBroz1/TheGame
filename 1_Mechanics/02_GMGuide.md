## Section 1: Introduction

As the Game Master, your task is to bring together a group of Players and guide
them through an Adventure. An Adventure can last for a single 2-3 hour session,
or it can unfold over the course of weeks, months, or even years in a continuous
narrative. You can bring together close friends in person, or find new friends
virtually through `MISSING` or in the Discord.

If you’ve been a Game Master elsewhere and are hoping to learn about what’s
different about being a Deck of Adventures Game Master, you can skip right to
Section 3, “Being a Deck of Adventures Game Master". For everyone else, or
those Game Masters who want a refresher, we’ll dive into what being a Game
Master is all about in Section 2: “Getting Started as a Game Master”. 

If you or your players have questions or need a helping hand, please reach out
to the team on [Discord] (https://discord.gg/tmHSdb3TRQ) or via GitHub issues.


## Section 2: Getting Started as a Game Master

Game Masters play referee and primary Storyteller in a Tabletop RPG like Deck of
Adventures. You are the arbiter of the rules, as well as the actor and
playwright who brings the various scenes of the story to life and voices the
majority of the characters who populate the world. You control when certain
characters enter a scene, and when they leave. Even the scene changes and
narration between scenes is a Game Master's responsibility. 

Game Masters are responsible for preparing materials ahead of sessions and
guiding a group of Players through a collaborative narrative in the form of an
Adventure. You bring the game to life for the Players at the table, and can
tell any type of story you would like. There is significant creative freedom in
being a Game Master, both with the types of stories you can tell, and the way
those stories unfold.  

Game Masters come in many styles and each Game Master brings their unique
strengths and talents to the table. Don't compare yourself to others,
especially those with significant experience at the table. This is a craft that
takes years to hone, and decades to master, but you can be a great Game Master
within your first few sessions of play if you follow this guide. The Community
also is available to offer advice, drawing from years of collective Game Master
experience, to support new Game Masters. 

As a Game Master, you need to be prepared to spend time outside of normal
session hours working on your Adventure. A well-prepared Adventure makes
running a session far easier than if you try to 'wing it'. Improvisation and
spontaneity are two vital ingredients to a great session of Deck of Adventures,
but having important things mapped out and planned ahead of time is important
for you as the Game Master. 

Sometimes, things you prepare ahead of time may not pan out perfectly, and that
is OK. The Players at the table each have their own creative agency, and the
actions and decisions of their characters are not predictable. When things
don't go to plan, don't force the players back into a prescribed narrative just
because you have that prepared. If the logical actions and outcomes of the
Players in the session lead to a different outcome, go with it. These will lead
to the most organic and well-remembered circumstances in your Adventure, and
Players and GMs work together to bring these moments to life. The Game Master
builds the world, populates it with characters and history, and then the
Players walk through that world and experience it first-hand. 


## Section 3: Being a Deck of Adventures Game Master

As a Deck of Adventures Game Master you are controlling the flow of card draws
constantly throughout a session. Your Players each have a single deck, which
gives you the ability to drain their resources steadily during a session to
have them feel challenged and tested while playing. 

You are also the primary resource of information for the world. Players will
come to you asking questions about the broader world or about a specific
character, and it is up to you to provide details and information. Even if
you are working off of previously written material, you must always be
prepared to go 'off script' and provide information about the world to a
player. It is OK to say you don't know something, or that you can give them
more information later outside of the session. It is encouraged for you to be
open to Player questions and ideas, and attempt to work with them to tell the
story rather than against them. 

You should be an impartial force in the world, controlling both allies and
enemies neutrally. The best sessions feel like
everyone is working together to complete an objective, even the GM, rather
than it feeling like a battle or competition between the Players and the Game
Master. This is a delicate balance, and GMs are encouraged to ask for their
Player's feedback on how they can improve, and it is also a GMs
responsibility to provide feedback to the Players at the table when necessary
to help everyone enjoy their experience at the table. 

### Game Master Resources

GMs should have several decks of cards available to them during a session so
as to easily represent multiple groups of Minions and Dealers that the
Players will fight during the course of an Adventure. At minimum, a GM must
maintain two separate decks - one for enemy combatants and one for allies of
the Players. If a GM only has one deck available, they should split the deck
into two 26 card decks and re-shuffle regularly. 

As the Game Master, you do not have to draw a single deck to empty. Unless a
Dealer you control has an individual deck assigned to them, and they are in
the active scene for long enough, the GM never invokes Lower Hand by needing
to reshuffle. If an NPC were to need a mechanical reason to show them being
exhausted, the same Status Condition can be added to that NPC as if they had
a level of fatigue.  

### Managing Player Resources

As the Game Master, you can design Adventures at your Table to test different
aspects of the Players and characters. Each Player holds a single deck of 52
cards, with two Fate Cards reserved at the beginning of play. Each character
has statistics that include total Health Points (HP), Fate Points (FP), and
Armor Points (AP). 

You can think of a Player's deck of cards like their character's stamina. The
Adventurers should get progressively more tired throughout the day. This is
accomplished by having the Players make a series of Checks, which is their
way of interacting with the world. At lower levels, it is OK for Players not
to approach the re-draw limit of running out of cards between Rests. However,
as players progress and level up, the Powers they choose and the Encounters
they face may test them closer to running out of cards between Rests. 

### Resting

HP and FP are also balanced by Rests. It is expected and recommended that a
party will take 1-2 Quick Rests between Full Rests during each day of in-game
time, depending on the Encounters they face. While Resting, the Players will
be regaining their Health and Fate Points, and expending Rest Cards. Keep this in mind when planning Encounters that deal damage,
since Players will want to take a Quick Rest if their HP or FP drop too low. 

To take a Rest, the Players consult with the Game Master whether it is
feasible for their characters to secure a 30-minute breather for a Quick
Rest, or a comfortable, uninterrupted full night's sleep with a Full Rest. If
a situation is tense, it may always be possible to take a Rest, and it is
ultimately the Game Master's decision whether a Rest is successfully
completed or not. In the event that a Rest is interrupted, it can be resumed
based on the remaining time left and extended as necessary. 

For example, if a group of Adventurers were attempting to spend the night in a
comfortable inn near the heart of a major city, a Full Rest would be easy to
secure. If that same group of Adventurers sneaks into the heart of a
bandit camp, been spotted, and run into a tent to hide, it would be more
difficult to secure that Rest. 

A Game Master plays the ultimate authority in the successful completion of a
Rest, and can ask the Players for a series of Checks to determine whether the
Rest can be completed or if another factor gets in the way. Players are
encouraged to work with their Game Master and with each other to preserve
resources in tense situations where Rests may not be easily achieved.       

### Working with Character Vulnerabilities

When Players create a character, they choose one or two (or more)
Vulnerabilities that they place on their character sheet. This may have
mechanical implications, but also impacts roleplay. GMs are highly
encouraged to keep these Vulnerabilities in mind when designing sessions or
running entire Adventures. These are narrative seeds that can be cultivated
over time to result in deep and meaningful moments for the Players.

Some Vulnerabilities have more severe mechanical consequences, and for those
that could lend itself to dangerous situations more often, it is recommended
to avoid leaning too heavily on this weakness. The Players should feel a
balance of being tough, heroic, and successful, alongside feeling like their
back is against a wall or they are being challenged in a meaningful way. This
fluctuation results in Players feeling strongly that their characters are
developing over time and the challenge keeps people engaged and critically
thinking. 

GM controlled NPCs can also have Vulnerabilities, so as you work to build
characters for your world that the Players may fight alongside or against,
keep in mind adding Vulnerabilities to those characters for the Players to
discover and potentially exploit. This helps the Players feel like they can
analyze the game one level deeper, and also by making certain NPCs more
nuanced and human it adds a layer of complexity to the Players experience of
playing the game.  

### Creating Your World 

## Section 4: Running a Session with Deck of Adventures

### The Target Card System

As a Game Master, you will set up various challenges and difficulties for the
Players throughout an Adventure. To resolve these challenges, a Player or GM
will draw a Target Card, and the opposing force makes a Check and draws a
card. The level of difficulty of a Check is set by the Difficulty Range,
which is how far away a pip value can be of the card being drawn relative to
the value of the Target Card. 

Keep in mind the Target Card System is circular, so an Ace is only 1 away from
both a King and a 2. 

| DR | -6 | -5 | -4 | -3 | -2 | -1 | 0 | +1 | +2 |
|---------:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Card | 8 | 9 | 10 | J | Q | K | A | 2 | 3 |


### Successes and Failures

- Successes are cards that are drawn with a pip value within the Difficulty
  Range. When a Check is successful, the character making the Check is able
  to accomplish what they were intending to do.
- Misses are cards that are drawn outside of the Difficulty Range. When a
  Check misses, the character making the Check is unable to accomplish what
  they were intending to do. 
- Critical Successes have a 1.9% chance of success. They should feel amazing
  for the Player. Make an effort to rewards these exact matches whenever you
  can with additional effects or bonuses.
- Major Successes have a 7.7% chance of success. This should still feel pretty
  good to your players. When drawn in Combat, a Major Success increases the
  damage of the attack. Make your out of combat bonuses feel just as good.
- Suited Successes occur when the card drawn falls within the Difficulty Range
  and matches the Suit of the Target Card. 
- A Player can use a Fate Card for a free re-draw, and if this turns a Miss
  into a Success you must ignore that there was a Miss. This is treated as a
  regular Success.


### Likelihood Chart

The chart below shows probability of success for the kinds of draws you will
typically encounter at each DR. Note that Color or Suit match divide the
likelihood by 2 and 4 respectively. The final row notes the difference caused
by drawing 2 cards at Upper or Lower Hand. At the ends, there isn't much of
an impact, but can increase or decrease the probability by as much as 25% for
a DR 3 check.

| DR          | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6    |
|------------:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:| :---:|
| Normal Draw | 8%  | 23% | 38% | 54% | 69% | 85% | 100% |
| Color Draw  | 4%  | 12% | 19% | 27% | 35% | 42% | 50%  |
| Suit Draw   | 2%  | 6%  | 10% | 13% | 17% | 21% | 25%  |
| Lower Hand 2| 1%  | 5%  | 15% | 29% | 48% | 72% | 100% |
| Upper Hand 2| 15% | 41% | 62% | 79% | 91% | 98% | 100% |
| Difference  |  7% | 18% | 24% | 25% | 21% | 13% | NA   |

### Fate Cards

It's up to you to decide how often you want players to use their Fate Cards.
By default players start with their 2 Jokers and will randomly gain Fate
Cards as they draw their Aces. If you want to give them more chances to
redraw, reward key moments of play by giving a Player a Fate Card. This can
be a great tool for encouraging great roleplay or working together. 

### Skills Breakdown

Players will want to make Checks based on their character's strengths. Their
approach to a situation should determine the nature of a check, but as the GM
you ultimately have the final say in which skill applies. Attributes are
meant to be more responsive/reactive, and are often used for Contested
Checks. Skills are intended to be more active for character-initiated events
such as scaling a wall or looking for something.

The below is a list of general information about the Attributes and Skills.
More information is available in the 
[Full Players Guide](https://github.com/DeckofAdventures/TheGame/blob/main/1_Mechanics/01_PlayerGuide_Full.md#Characters)

- AGL Agility: Dodging Contested Checks, boosts Unarmored AC
   - Finesse: Primary Skill for Martial
   - Stealth: how quietly you can move about
- CON Conviction: Resistance to harmful effects, strength of personality
   - Bluffing: how convincing you are, lying or truthful
   - Performance: success for activities in front of large audiences
- GUT Intuition: Inexplicable gut feelings (e.g., truthfulness, supernatural
  knowledge)
   - Detection: observing the world, taking in the surroundings using all of
     your senses
   - Craft: Primary Skill for Support, practicing a trade (Medicine, Pottery,
     Piety)
- INT Intelligence: Thinking on the fly, rapidly recalling information
   - Knowledge: Primary Skill for Casters, how much you know with regards to
     history or science
   - Investigation: Actively seeking the answer to a specific question using
     senses and acumen
- STR Strength: Physical limits and boundaries, useful in resisting a push or
  catching a boulder.
   - Athletics: Sustained exertion.
   - Brute: Primary Skill for Defenders, a burst hit or single heavy lift.
- VIT Vitality: Determines HP, resistance of disease.

### Contested Checks

Contested Checks are initiated when two opposing forces are attempting to
accomplish something at the same time. This can be someone attempting to push
someone else over, a Player trying to convince an NPC that they are an ally,
or with the use of certain Powers. 

For the most updated reference and ruling on Contested Checks, visit the
[Full Player Guide](https://github.com/DeckofAdventures/TheGame/blob/main/1_Mechanics/01_PlayerGuide_Full.md#contested-checks)

Here are some Examples of Skills that are used in Contested Checks, though you
are free to decide what makes the most sense in a given scenario at your
table. 
1. Tackle Target: Attacker Finesse vs. Target Athletics 
2. Convince Target, truthfully or deceptively: Bluffing vs. Target Detection 
3. `MISSING`

### Epic Events 

Epic Events are unique, time-gated scenarios that can occur throughout an
Adventure. As the Game Master, you determine when an Epic Event will happen,
set the Difficulty, and decide the Stakes. 

#### How to Identify an Epic Event

Epic Events occur within a specific set amount of time, typically best for
anything that would unfold in less than a minute. They invoke a specific set
of rules for determining the outcome, which is different than traditional
combat, social interaction, or exploration. 

Setting an Epic Event during a session typically is a good way to engage all
of your players in a faster-paced, more free-form set of roleplaying. Since
Players can't make a Check two times in a row, it requires active dialogue,
planning, and participation from every Player. It is recommended to stick to
one or two Epic Events per session, so as to keep it feeling unique and not
drain too much Stamina from the Players, though as the Game Master you can
set as many as you would like. 

An Epic Event can be the group attempting to escape a crumbling fortress, or
escape an island with an erupting volcano. It can cover things that are
smaller in scope, such as a single point on a larger battlefield, or it can
determine the outcome of an entire battle itself. As the Game Master, you
will get a feel for what makes for a good Epic Event, and how to place it in
your narrative to keep the session feeling fresh and lively for all of your
Players.

For more information on Epic Events, visit the [Full Player Guide](https://github.com/DeckofAdventures/TheGame/blob/main/1_Mechanics/01_PlayerGuide_Full.md#Epic-Events)

#### Setting an Epic Event's Difficulty

You determine the Difficulty of an Epic Event ahead of time and announce the
Difficulty at the beginning of the Epic Event. This is how many total
Successes will be needed to complete the Epic Event before 3 Failures. 

Setting an Epic Event with a Difficulty of 4 means that the Players need make
4 Successful Checks before reaching 3 Failures. The Game Master can modify
this difficulty or adjust the Stakes depending how many Failures there are
before reaching the number of Successes required.

#### Deciding the Stakes

The Stakes of an Epic Event are the outcomes of both Success and Failure for
the Players. Going into an Epic Event, there is no guarantee of Success, even
at lower Difficulties. It is highly recommended to ensure you have outcomes
correctly balanced and prepared for the scope of the Epic Event. Not all Epic
Events are life-or-death scenarios, and consequences can vary depending on
the degree of failure. 

If Players are trying to escape a building before it collapses, and they are
unsuccessful, they can each take a certain amount of damage or discard a
number of cards based on the number of successes before they failed.
Likewise, if the Players are successful without getting any failures, the
reward for their success can be balanced accordingly. 

<!-- MISSING - a table or reference of standard success/failures + example
 stakes for certain types of scenarios --> 

#### An Example of an Epic Event

The Players hear screaming in the distance, and rush to investigate. From 100
feet away, they can see a group of townsfolk being attacked by a group of
monsters. Each townsfolk is engaged with a different monster. The Difficulty
is set to 3, and 5 target cards are drawn. The Players then declare which
skill they will use to save one of the townsfolk, and must make a suited hit
before the GM does to succeed on each TC. 

- The Defender chooses to use Brute to intercede with one of the monsters and
  distract it while the Townsfolk gets away. The GM decides based on the
  skill chosen and the scenario what the DR would be, in this case choosing
  DR 3 on a Target Card of 9 of Hearts. The Defender has a +2 to Brute, and
  draws a 6 of Hearts. This is a success, since it is within the DR and
  matches the suit, and the townsfolk is able to escape safely. The Target
  Card is flipped over, marking one success. 

- The Support wants to protect a townsfolk using Craft, which they have a +1
  modifier. The GM rules this more difficult, making it a DR 2 on a TC of 7
  of Clubs. The Support draws a 3 of Diamonds, which is a miss. The GM then
  draws, without a modifier, against this same TC. They draw a 6 of Spades.
  Also a miss. They go back and forth for a few more draws until the Support
  draws a 5 of Clubs, which is a success. 

- The Martial wants to sneak up to a townsfolk and help them escape out from
  under the monster's grasp, intending to use Stealth which they have a +2
  in. The GM rules this as moderately difficult, making it a DR 2 on a TC of
  Jack of Spades. The Martial draws first, and misses. The GM draws a King of
  Spades, which makes it the first failure for the Players.

- The Caster and Support both go for the fourth TC together, each with their
  primary skill modifier. The DR is set to a 3, and they each draw first,
  missing the TC. The GM draws, and misses. The Caster misses again, but uses
  a Fate Card to re-draw and draws a suited hit. This marks a 3rd success for
  the Players, which ends the Epic Event.

The Players watch as the monsters retreat, having saved the majority of the
townsfolk. Since there was one failure, one of the townsfolk has been gravely
injured and was dragged away with the monsters as they retreated. The Players
can choose to follow after the monsters or regroup with the townsfolk they
saved, having successfully prevented more lives from being lost. This can
result in a reward from the local government for saving lives, or kick off a
new Adventure that involves seeking out the monsters in their lair and
putting a stop to them.    

### Running Combat

Deck of Adventures combat is meant to be fast-paced, collaborative, and
accessible. It is simple in many ways while allowing for complexity and a lot
of player freedom in other ways. Some sessions of Deck of Adventures may be
very focused on combat, with 3-4 combat encounters between Full Rests, while
other sessions may be more RP based, with social encounters and exploration.
As the Game Master, you decide what is best for your table. Some Players may
be more interested in combat, while others get excited and engaged with good
social RP, and it is up to you as the GM to balance the interests of the
Players at the table. You are encouraged to ask the Players directly what
they would prefer, and work to build sessions around their preferences,
especially early on at a new table before everyone's preferences are
explicitly understood.  

To run combat in Deck of Adventures successfully, the GM needs to plan their
encounters thoughtfully and be able to adapt on the fly when Players make
unexpected strategic decisions. There are ways to build encounters that allow
the Players to highlight their strengths, and other ways to optimize an
encounter to address some of the weaknesses or Vulnerabilities the Players
have. 

For example, if a Player takes a new Power during a level up, you can build an
encounter to allow that Player a chance to shine. If they just took an Area
of Attack (AOE) power that allows them to hit many enemies bunched up, set up
a Combat Encounter with many smaller foes that are swarming the Players. This
will give the Player an opportunity to get to use the Power they were clearly
excited about taking. 

Vulnerabilities may have combat implications as well as an effect on roleplay
that you as the GM can leverage. If a Player is Wanted, you can have the
faction that is hunting them appear in the session, and you could choose to
explicitly engage in combat and have them approach as hostile, or give the
Players an opportunity to Roleplay their way out of the situation if they
choose, or attack the enemies themselves.  


#### Setting up Combat Encounters 

As the Game Master, you get to decide what types of Combat Encounters you will
have during a session. Do you want to pit the Players against a single strong
foe, who can stand toe-to-toe with the entire 3-6 Player team in a Combat? Or
do you want to throw smaller enemies, maybe with a single stronger foe they
are supporting, in a more complex and larger-scale battle scene? The choice
is yours - and often a session may have a mix of combat encounters. 

It is recommended for a session to include a mix of roleplay and combat,
though depending on the scenario the Encounters may be more combat focused.
Storming an enemy fortress, for example, may result in several Combat
Encounters that are fought closely together, while investigating a crime in a
major city may have more social investigation roleplay with one or two combat
encounters. 

### Dealers, Minions, Bystanders, and Companions  

- *Minions* are enemies that are weaker than the Players. They usually have
   lower HP, and they cannot take Powers or Vulnerabilities. Minions do not
   have access to Fate Cards, and as the GM you would draw from a shared deck
   of cards whenever Minions are present.

- *Dealers* are as powerful if not more powerful than the Players. They are
   the movers and shakers of the world, and often command Minions on the
   battlefield. GMs draw from a separate deck of cards on behalf of each
   Dealer, and these Dealers can use Fate Cards. Each Dealer starts with one
   Fate Card, and reserves Aces when drawn. Dealers can also take Powers and
   Vulnerabilities, and may be in possession of powerful items and equipment.
   See below for how to turn a Dealer into a Boss. 

- *Bystanders* are allied or neutral characters that exist throughout the
   world. A Bystander might be a shop keep or a local inn keeper, or an
   emissary from a neighboring land. These are typically on par in power with
   Minions, though some Bystanders are considerably more powerful and can
   join the Players in combat as Companions.  
- *Companions* are Player controlled creatures that are allied to the Players.
   They can be commanded with an Action, and Players can invest in Powers
   that make their Companion more powerful. Some Companions can join the
   Players as part of an Adventure, unrelated to XP cost, while others are
   taken with XP on Level Up. As the GM, you decide whether or not a
   Bystander will join the Players as a Companion, and for how long. 

### Creating a Boss Battle 

Certain enemies are by nature more powerful, and gain additional benefits and
Actions that are not present in other types of Encounters. Any Dealer could
be considered a Boss, and GMs are encouraged to use *Adversary Actions*
whenever a Dealer is present to make them feel more threatening. Adding
in *House Actions* can create a dynamic and exciting Boss encounter that the
Players will remember.

Boss Battles are best saved for the end of Adventures, whether
that spans a single session and is the enemy the Players face at the end of
their day's journey, or if it is an encounter at the end of an Adventure that
is several sessions long, and the Boss is the final piece of the Adventure to
complete. As the GM, you can choose when to place a Boss Battle in your
Adventure, as well as what Actions they should have.    

#### Adversary Actions

An enemy Dealer is a dangerous foe for the Players to face. Adversary Actions
help balance encounters where a single Dealer might be facing a group of 3-6
Players. A Dealer can take an Adversary Action at the end of any creature's
turn, interrupting turn order to take their Action. This allows for a
balanced Action Economy within an Encounter where the Players may be facing a
single Dealer or a small group and a single Dealer. Using Adversary Actions
helps give the Players a sense of the power and danger of a single enemy. 

Some Adversary Actions may be related to resource replenishment, such as
allowing a Dealer to recover a small amount of HP or gain AP. Other Adversary
Actions could be making an additional attack, or affecting the environment in
such a way as to make the Players make a Check or take damage or receive a
Status Condition like Entangled. 

Here is an example Adversary Action that a poison wielding enemy might use: 
- Acid Splash, a cloud of acid appears in a 4 space cube. Any creature within
  the cloud when it appears must make a DR 3 Agility Check. On a failure,
  take 2 damage. On a success, take half damage.   

#### House Actions

These are Actions that happen at the beginning of every round of combat during
a Boss Battle. Once every Dealer and Minion has made their turn, and the
first in the turn order would go again, a House Action can trigger. This is a
great way to add in dynamic elements to an encounter, such as new enemies
appearing or a Phase change for a Boss. Some House Actions can be randomized
by creating a table of possibilities, and drawing a card at the top of every
round.

Think about the Boss you are trying to create. Would there be more Minions
nearby, ready to be summoned by the call of their Master? Or does their lair
contain traps or other hidden secrets that could be exposed during the course
of a longer battle. Get creative with it!  

### Example Combat Encounter designed for 4 Players at level 2

Here is an example encounter that you could run with your Players to see how
they think during combat. In a longer campaign, it is recommended that you
mix it up with different types of encounters to see how the Players react and
interact with each other, and this also has the added benefit of keeping
things fresh so combat continues to feel high-stakes and fun session after
session.

Lore is kept purposefully blank - feel free to fill it in with the world you
are most interested in! Below are suggested stats and abilities for each of
the enemies, though as the GM you are free to modify or tweak as you see
fit. 

For this encounter, you want a wide open space for the Players and enemies to
move around in. Look for a generic battle map, between 10-20 spaces across.
This allows for movement and range to come into play in a meaningful way,
which adds to the complexity of the encounter. 

The Encounter contains 1 Dealer and 4 Minions. The enemy Dealer should be
positioned farther away from the Players at first, with the two Guards up
closest to the Players and the Shooters positioned between 3-5 spaces away
from the Dealer each. This will force the Players to choose their targets and
allows for space between each enemy. The Players will need to deal with the
Guards first in order to reach the Dealer, and gives the Dealer time to use
their abilities in the first two rounds before the Minions are fully
defeated.  

**Dealer: Captain**
- HP: 5
- AR: 2 (Lightly armored)
- FP: 2
- Skill Modifiers: Agi +2, Str +2, Vit +2
- Passives: Multiattack, the Dealer can make two attacks on its turn. Lucky,
  on a suited miss the Dealer can make one free redraw. 
- Vulnerabilities: Eye for an Eye, if you attack in combat, you must target
  the enemy who hit you most recently.
- Actions:   
  - Major Actions: Attack, Melee, +2 to hit, 1 space range, single target. On
    a successful hit, deal 1 damage. Attack, Ranged, +1 to hit, 8 space
    range, single target. On a successful hit, deal 1 damage.  
  - Minor Actions: Speed Boost, double the Dealer's movement.   
  - Adversary Actions: Break Stun, when the Dealer is stunned, as an Adversary
