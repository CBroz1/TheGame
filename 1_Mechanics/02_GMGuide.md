# GM’s Guide to Pelagia

# Introduction

> You’ve entered the world of Pelagia as a player, and realized you wanted to become a Storyteller, one of the most important parts of Pelagia. This is how our voices spread through the heavens. Once known as “Beedle Bards,” Storytellers have taken shape all throughout the known Cosmiverse.
> Respected and honored, Storytellers are welcome at every hearth and home, every tavern and table, for the joyful company they bring. They tell of adventures, and entertain those around them by allowing them to live, for a time, within those adventures. Storytellers are known wide and far for their ability, some even call it Magic, to weave a story between multiple listeners and spectators and for them to feel they have lived those adventures for themselves.
> This is the magic you might wield, oh reader. Guides may lie ahead, but the true spirit must come from deep within you.
> Humbly,
> Duke Beedle of Pelagia

As the Game Master, your task is to bring together a group of adventurers and guide them through a Story of Pelagia. You can bring together close friends in person, or find new friends Virtually through ExampleWebsite.com or in the Discord. 

If you’ve been a Game Master elsewhere and are hoping to learn about what’s different about being a Game Master of Pelagia, you can skip right to Section 3, “What it’s all about”. For everyone else, or those Game Masters who want a refresher, we’ll dive into what being a Game Master is all about in Section 2: “Getting Started”.
