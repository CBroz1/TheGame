# Introduction

> You’ve entered the world of Pelagia as a player, and realized you wanted to become a
Storyteller, one of the most important parts of Pelagia. This is how our voices spread
through the heavens. Once known as “Beedle Bards,” Storytellers have taken shape all
throughout the known Cosmiverse.
> Respected and honored, Storytellers are welcome at every hearth and home, every tavern
and table, for the joyful company they bring. They tell of adventures, and entertain
those around them by allowing them to live, for a time, within those adventures.
Storytellers are known wide and far for their ability, some even call it Magic, to weave
a story between multiple listeners and spectators and for them to feel they have lived
those adventures for themselves.
> This is the magic you might wield, oh reader. Guides may lie ahead, but the true spirit
must come from deep within you.

> Humbly,
> Duke Beedle of Pelagia

As the Game Master, your task is to bring together a group of adventurers and guide them
through a Story of Pelagia. You can bring together close friends in person, or find new
friends Virtually through ExampleWebsite.com or in the Discord.

If you’ve been a Game Master elsewhere and are hoping to learn about what’s different
about being a Game Master of Pelagia, you can skip right to Section 3, “What it’s all
about”. For everyone else, or those Game Masters who want a refresher, we’ll dive into
what being a Game Master is all about in Section 2: “Getting Started”. If you or your
players ever have questions or need a helping hand, never be afraid to reach out to the
team on Discord `LINK NEEDED` or via GitHub issues.

## Running a Session with Deck of Adventures

### Successes and Failures

- Critical Successes have a 1.9% chance of success. They should feel amazing. Make an 
  effort to rewards these exact matches whenever you can.
- Major Successes have a 7.7% chance of success. This should still feel pretty good to
  your players. 
- Successes.
- Misses.

### Likelihood Chart

The closer a TC is to the end of the spectrum, the less an expanded DC will matter in 
determining the outcome. 7 and 8, for example have the full range, but above and below, 
the end of your DC range will hit the Ace. This shouldn't dramatically impact play, 
but is worth considering at crucial moments.
