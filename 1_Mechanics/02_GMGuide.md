## Introduction

As the Game Master (GM), your task is to bring together a group of Players and guide
them through an Adventure. An Adventure can last for a single 2-3 hour session,
or it can unfold over the course of weeks, months, or even years in a continuous
narrative. You can bring together close friends in person, or find new friends
virtually through the [Discord](https://discord.gg/2Wu6ZAb6S9).

If you’ve been a GM elsewhere and are hoping to learn about what’s
different about being a Deck of Adventures Game Master, you can skip right to
[Being a Deck of Adventures Game Master](#Being-a-Deck-of-Adventures-Game-Master). 
For everyone else, or
those GMs who want a refresher, we will dive into what being a GM
is all about in 
[Getting Started as a Game Master](#Getting-Started-as-a-Game-Master). 

If you or your players have questions or need a helping hand, please reach out
to the team on [Discord](https://discord.gg/2Wu6ZAb6S9) or via GitHub issues.


## Getting Started as a Game Master

<!-- 
Needs a notes about 
  1. what a DM screen is, literally and metaphorically 
  2. checks - why this is how ppl interact with the world, why add randomness?
  3. resource management - move up from DofA specific. Flow state is achieved when we're
     at the peak of our ability and met with the exact level of challenge to fit our 
     skills. To keep players engaged, dial in the difficulty to where they're feeling
     challenged in a way that suits their play style, without worrying about what they 
     have left.
-->

Game Masters (GMs) play referee and narrator in a Tabletop RPG like Deck of
Adventures (DofA). You are both the arbiter of the rules, and the actor/playwright 
who brings the various scenes of the story to life and voices the
majority of the characters who populate the world. You control when certain
characters come and go, scene changes, and the
narration between scenes. 

GMs are responsible for preparing ahead of sessions and
guiding a group of Players through a collaborative narrative
Adventure. You bring the game to life with
any type of story you can imagine. There are so many possibilities as 
Game Master.

There are many different approaches GMs take to this role, focusing on unique
strengths and talents. Don't compare yourself to others,
especially those with years of experience. This craft
takes years to hone, and decades to master, but you can be a great GM
within your first few sessions by following some of the advice in this guide. 
The DofA Community
also is available to respond to questions and offer advice, drawing from years of collective
experience. 

<!-- moved up from below --> 
You should be an impartial force in the world, controlling both allies and
enemies neutrally. The best sessions feel like
everyone is working together to complete an objective, even the GM, rather
than competition between Players and GM. 
This is a delicate balance, and GMs should ask for
Players' feedback. It's also a GM's
responsibility to provide feedback to the Players at the table when necessary,
especially if one's play style may be a distraction to others at the table. 

As a GM, you will need to spend time outside of normal
session hours working on your Adventure. You will be 
the primary resource for information about the world. 
Players will ask questions, and it's up to you to provide details, even if
it's improvised. It's also OK to say you don't know something, or that you'll need
to get back to them after the session. You should 
open to Player questions and ideas, and work with them to tell the
story rather, as much as possible. 
Improvisation and
spontaneity are two vital ingredients to a great session,
but having key moments mapped out is important to shaping the Players' experience. 
What you prepare may not pan out perfectly, and that's part of the fun. 
The Players bring their own creative agency, and 
can be unpredictable. It's important not to
force the players back into a prescribed narrative. 
If the Players logically lead the
the session in a different direction, go with it. 
The Players also may not know when story beats are improvised, but these can be
the most organic and memorable Adventures. The GM
builds the world, populates it with characters and history, and then the
Players walk through that world and experience it first-hand. 


## Being a Deck of Adventures Game Master

As a Deck of Adventures (DofA) Game Master (GM) you are controlling the flow of card draws
on both sides of the table.

### Game Master Resources

Game Masters (GMs) should have at least two decks of cards available during a session to
represent allies and enemies. More decks may be useful to represent different
groups. If you only have one deck available, split it into
two 26-card decks and shuffle regularly. 

Most NPCs won't stick around long enough to use a deck completely, and 
won't shuffle prematurely, invoking Lower Hand. For the
exceptional NPC, try assigning them a deck, if available. If 
unavailable, you can decide when to invoke Lower Hand behind the DM screen.

### Managing Player Resources

Adventures can also be designed to test different
aspects of the Players and characters. Each Player holds a single deck of 52
cards, with two Fate Cards reserved at the beginning of play. Each character
has statistics that include total Health Points (HP), Fate Points (FP), and
Armor Points (AP). 

### Cards

Players' decks are like their character's stamina. As cards are drawn,
they should get progressively more tired throughout the day via Checks and Powers.
At lower levels, Players may not reach the end of their decks
between Rests to incur Lower Hand penalties. As Players
level up, both the Powers they use and the Encounters they face
may require more draws, bringing them closer to running out. 

### Resting

Health and Fate Points are also balanced by Rests. Players should 
take 1-2 Quick Rests between Full Rests during each day of in-game
time, depending on the Encounters they face. While Resting, the Players will
be regaining their HP and FP, and expending Rest Cards. 
When planning Encounters that deal damage, keep these resources in mind.
Try to keep Players motivated to press on, even without full resources. 
They may want to take a Quick Rest p if their HP or FP drop too low. 

To Rest, Players will consult with the GM about whether it is
feasible for their characters to secure a 30-minute or 8-hour break uninterrupted
If a situation is tense, it may not always be possible to gain the benefits of a Rest. 
In the event that a Rest is interrupted, it can be resumed
based on the remaining time left and extended as necessary. 
For example, a Full Rest would be easy to secure at a
comfortable inn in a major city. 
A temporary hiding spot in an enemy bandit camp would me much more risky. 
You could use (a) a Player stealth Check (b) an enemy detection Check, or (c) an Epic 
Event to see if they are interrupted. 
As the GM, you have the ultimate authority in the successful completion of a
Rest. Encourage players to 
work with each other to make the best decision given circumstances.

### Working with Character Vulnerabilities

Each character can have one or two (or more)
Vulnerabilities, which may have
mechanical and/or roleplay implications. GMs are highly
encouraged to keep these Vulnerabilities in mind when designing 
Adventures. For Players, these are narrative seeds that can be cultivated
to result in truly meaningful moments for the Players. 

For Player Vulnerabilities with more severe mechanical consequences, or those
that could lead to dangerous situations, GMs should
avoid planning too much on this weakness. The Players should feel like
their Vulnerabilities add to the richness of the story, and ultimately rewarded
for taking on the challenge. A Vulnerability should result in feeling a
balance of toughness and heroism despite the odds. At its best,
Vulnerabilities will inspire characters that 
develop over time, intertwining with a broader narrative.

For NPCs, Vulnerabilities can add depth to an otherwise flat archetype 
of merchant or farmer. Are there Vulnerabilities that can work 
to challenge the values of Players? What foils can help Players flesh out their 
character by disagreeing with another. Seeing a corruptible guard might really activate
a character focused on justice. Enemy NPC Vulnerabilities also give Players something
to exploit, though deeper analysis of the world. Yes, one Player can do consistent 
damage by continuing to attack, but another could spend a turn studying movements to
learn that their adversary has an injury and can't defend against specific attacks.
Perhaps an enemy has specific values that could be used to turn them into an ally.

### Creating Your World

`MISSING`

<!-- BROZ: How much here should be in DofA-specific? Feels like new-DM topic to me -->

## Running a Session with Deck of Adventures

### The Target Card System

As a Game Master (GM), you will set up various challenges wherein
you or a Player
will draw a Target Card (TC), and the other draws against that card to make a Check.
The level of difficulty of a Check is set by the Difficulty Range (DR),
which is the distance between pip values that will still count as a success. 
The Target Card System is circular, so an Ace is only 1 away from
both a King and a 2. 

| DR   | -6  | -5  | -4  | -3  | -2  | -1  | 0   | +1  | +2  | +3  | +4  | +5  | +6  |
|---:  |:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Card | 8   | 9   | 10  | J   | Q   | K   | A   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   |

### Successes and Failures

- **Successes** happen when the drawn card is within the DR. 
  The character making the Check is able to accomplish what they intended, within reason.

- **Misses** happen when the drawn card is outside the DR.
  The character making the Check is not able to accomplish what they intended. 

- **Critical Successes** happen when the drawn card exactly matches the TC in 
  pip value and suit. At 1.9% chance, they should feel amazing
  for the Player. Make an effort to rewards these exact matches whenever possible
  with additional effects or bonuses.

- **Major Successes** happen when the drawn card matches the TC in pip value 
  At 7.7% chance, this should feel pretty
  good. In Combat, a Major Success increases the
  damage of the attack by 1. Out of combat, some smaller bonus should happen whenever 
  possible.

- **Color and Suited Successes** happen when the drawn card is within the DR and 
  matches the TC in color or suit. 

- **Fate Cards**  permit a Dealer (Player character or significant NPC) to redraw. If
  this changes the success state, the first draw should be ignored.

<!-- 
    BROZ: Previously, on Fate Cards: This is treated as a regular Success. 
          This implies the second draw can't crit. I'm not sure I would want that.
-->

### Likelihood Chart

The chart below shows probability of success for the most frequent draws at each
Difficulty Range (DR). 
To further dial in the difficulty, you might say that a specific check requires a 
Color or Suited Success. 
Note that Color or Suit make success half or a quarter as likely. 
Some mechanics or GM rulings can call for checks to be made at Upper or Lower hand, 
drawing (up to) 2 or more cards, and taking the more or less benefitial result.
The final row notes the difference caused 
by drawing 2 cards. At DR 0 or 6, there's little difference, but it can be
as much as 25% for
a DR 3 check.

| DR          | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6    |
|------------:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:| :---:|
| Normal Draw | 8%  | 23% | 38% | 54% | 69% | 85% | 100% |
| Color Draw  | 4%  | 12% | 19% | 27% | 35% | 42% | 50%  |
| Suit Draw   | 2%  | 6%  | 10% | 13% | 17% | 21% | 25%  |
| Lower Hand 2| 1%  | 5%  | 15% | 29% | 48% | 72% | 100% |
| Upper Hand 2| 15% | 41% | 62% | 79% | 91% | 98% | 100% |
| Difference  |  7% | 18% | 24% | 25% | 21% | 13% | NA   |

### Fate Cards

Players start with their 2 Jokers and will randomly gain Fate
Cards as they draw their Aces. As a GM, you can promote using Fate Cards by
give more to reward key moments of play. This can
be a great tool for encouraging great roleplay or working together. 

### Skills Breakdown

Players will want to make Checks based on their characters' strengths. Their
approach to a situation should determine the nature of a check. As the GM,
you have the final say as to which skill applies. Attributes are
meant to be more responsive/reactive, and are often used for Contested
Checks. Skills are intended to be more active for character-initiated events.

The list below provides of general information about the Attributes and Skills (see
[Full Players Guide](../01_PlayerGuide_Full.md#Characters) 
for more info).

<!-- BROZ: Do you want links to go to github or the site? I replaced with a relative
           doc link, which should work on both, not certain -->

- AGL Agility: Dodging Contested Checks, boosts Unarmored AC.
    - Finesse: Performing difficult actions with ease. Primary Skill for Martial role.
    - Stealth: Moving quietly, undetected.

- CON Conviction: Strength of character to resist harmful mental effects.
    - Bluffing: Convincing others, either truthfully or deceptively.
    - Performance: Acting under scrutiny, potentially in front of audiences.

- GUT Intuition: Gut feelings about the state of the world (e.g., truthfulness, 
  supernatural knowledge)
    - Detection: Observing the world using all senses.
    - Craft: Practicing a honed trade (i.e., Medicine, Pottery, Piety). 
      Primary Skill for Support role.

- INT Intelligence: Reactive critical thinking or recalling recalling explicit information.
    - Knowledge: Recalling and amassing knowledge at leisure. Primary Skill for Casters.
    - Investigation: Seeking the answer a question or piecing together information.

- STR Strength: Physical limits and boundaries (e.g,. resisting a push).
    - Athletics: Exerting oneself in physical sustained challenge.
    - Brute: Burst force or single lifts. Primary Skill for Defenders. 

- VIT Vitality: Resisting bodily harm. Determines max HP.

### Contested Checks

Contested Checks are initiated when two characters attempt to
accomplish opposite goals, or one character attempting to overcome the resistance of 
another (see 
[Full Player Guide](../01_PlayerGuide_Full.md#contested-checks) for more info).

The list below features some examples, but, as the GM, it's up to you to decide what
a situation calls for if it is not explicitly described in the manual or in a Power
mechanic.

1. Tackle Target: Initiator Finesse vs. Target Athletics 
2. Convince Target, truthfully or deceptively: Initiator Bluffing vs. Target Detection 
3. `MISSING`

### Epic Events

<!-- BROZ: I think this could be revised referring back to the same example repeatedly
           the way I did for the player guide successes.
 -->

Epic Events are unique, time-gated scenarios that can occur throughout an
Adventure. As the Game Master (GM), you determine when an Epic Event will happen,
set the Difficulty, and decide the stakes. 

Epic Events invoke a specific set
of rules for determining the outcome, which is different than traditional
combat, social interaction, or exploration. These are typically very draining on 
Player stamina (remaining decks), and could be a tool to engage resource management.
This is also is a good way to engage all
Players in faster-paced, more free-form roleplaying. Since
Players can't make a Check two times in a row, it requires active dialogue,
planning, and participation from every Player.

For more information on Epic Events, visit the [Full Player Guide](https://github.com/DeckofAdventures/TheGame/blob/main/1_Mechanics/01_PlayerGuide_Full.md#Epic-Events)

#### How to Identify an Epic Event

<!-- BROZ: I think Epic could also be used for time skips. Do we want to first-person
           this long treck from A to B or Epic it? Or replace the 2-year gap training 
           montage
-->

Epic Events often occur within a limited time frame, typically
less than a minute, and typically no more than twice per session. This could be a
fleeing event under some thread of harm (e.g., a crumbling dungeon or
an erupting volcano), or an unexpected smaller scenario (e.g., preventing an 
uncontrolled vehicle from crashing). It can cover a small scope (e.g, a moment of 
surprise that begins a larger battlefield), something larger (e.g., replace an entire
combat), or even be used to shrink time skips (e.g., dealing with the storms and 
resource management of travel across a sea). As GM, you
will get a feel for what makes for a good Epic Event, and how to place it in
your narrative to keep the session feeling fresh and lively for all of your
Players.


#### Setting an Epic Event's Difficulty

The GM sets the difficulty ahead by announcing how many 
Successes will be needed before 3 Failures. 
Setting an a difficulty of 4 means that the Players need to
make 4 successful Checks before reaching 3 failures. 

#### Deciding the Stakes

Going into an Epic Event, there is no guarantee of Success, even
at lower Difficulties. Try to balance the outcomes based on the scope of the
Epic Event. Not all Epic Events are life-or-death scenarios, and consequences
can vary depending on the number of success before 3 failures. 

If Players get 3 Failures trying to escape a collapsing dungeon, they may
take a little damage or need to discard some cards, or lose a precious object in the 
fray. 
Likewise, if the Players are successful without any failures, the
reward for their success can be balanced accordingly. 
<!-- BROZ: editing bookmark -->

<!-- MISSING - a table or reference of standard success/failures + example
 stakes for certain types of scenarios --> 

#### An Example of an Epic Event

The Players hear screaming in the distance, and rush to investigate. From 100
feet away, they can see a group of townsfolk being attacked by a group of
monsters. Each townsfolk is engaged with a different monster. The Difficulty
is set to 3, and 5 target cards are drawn. The Players then declare which
skill they will use to save one of the townsfolk, and must make a suited hit
before the GM does to succeed on each TC. 

- The Defender chooses to use Brute to intercede with one of the monsters and
  distract it while the Townsfolk gets away. The GM decides based on the
  skill chosen and the scenario what the DR would be, in this case choosing
  DR 3 on a Target Card of 9 of Hearts. The Defender has a +2 to Brute, and
  draws a 6 of Hearts. This is a success, since it is within the DR and
  matches the suit, and the townsfolk is able to escape safely. The Target
  Card is flipped over, marking one success. 

- The Support wants to protect a townsfolk using Craft, which they have a +1
  modifier. The GM rules this more difficult, making it a DR 2 on a TC of 7
  of Clubs. The Support draws a 3 of Diamonds, which is a miss. The GM then
  draws, without a modifier, against this same TC. They draw a 6 of Spades.
  Also a miss. They go back and forth for a few more draws until the Support
  draws a 5 of Clubs, which is a success. 

- The Martial wants to sneak up to a townsfolk and help them escape out from
  under the monster's grasp, intending to use Stealth which they have a +2
  in. The GM rules this as moderately difficult, making it a DR 2 on a TC of
  Jack of Spades. The Martial draws first, and misses. The GM draws a King of
  Spades, which makes it the first failure for the Players.

- The Caster and Support both go for the fourth TC together, each with their
  primary skill modifier. The DR is set to a 3, and they each draw first,
  missing the TC. The GM draws, and misses. The Caster misses again, but uses
  a Fate Card to re-draw and draws a suited hit. This marks a 3rd success for
  the Players, which ends the Epic Event.

The Players watch as the monsters retreat, having saved the majority of the
townsfolk. Since there was one failure, one of the townsfolk has been gravely
injured and was dragged away with the monsters as they retreated. The Players
can choose to follow after the monsters or regroup with the townsfolk they
saved, having successfully prevented more lives from being lost. This can
result in a reward from the local government for saving lives, or kick off a
new Adventure that involves seeking out the monsters in their lair and
putting a stop to them.    

### Combat

Deck of Adventures combat is meant to be fast-paced, collaborative, and
accessible. It is designed with a simple core, while allowing for a lot of
player freedom based on how they built their character. 

To run combat in Deck of Adventures successfully, you should plan encounters
thoughtfully and be able to adapt on the fly when Players make unexpected
strategic decisions. 

Some sessions of Deck of Adventures may be very focused on combat, with 3-4
combat encounters between Full Rests. Other sessions may be more centered
around roleplay, with social encounters and exploration. As the Game Master,
you decide what mix is best for your table. Some Players may be more interested
in combat, while others get excited and engaged with good social roleplay, and it
is up to you as the GM to balance the interests of the Players at the table.

You can ask the Players directly what they would prefer, and work to build
sessions around their preferences, especially early on at a new table before
everyone's preferences are explicitly understood.  

#### Initiating Combat

You choose when to declare the beginning of Combat, and this triggers the
start of Combat Turn Order. The start of combat depends entirely on the
scenario. It might begin when the Players decide to attack an enemy, or when
an enemy is about to attack the Players. 

To determine Turn Order, have every Player draw a Target Card for their
character. You will draw a TC for each Minion and Dealer involved in the
Encounter, including any new enemies that appear throughout Combat. 

When drawing TCs for Turn Order, you can draw a single TC for a group of
Minions to make them easier to manage. A Dealer must always have their own
TC.

#### Strengths and Weaknesses

There are ways to build encounters that allow the Players to highlight their
character's strengths, and other ways to optimize an encounter to address
those characters' Vulnerabilities. 

For example, if a Player takes a new Power during a level up, you can build an
encounter to allow that Player a chance to shine. If they just took an Area
of Attack (AOE) power that allows them to hit many enemies close together,
set up a Combat Encounter with many smaller foes that are swarming the
Players. This will give that Player an opportunity to get to use the Power
they were excited about taking. 

Vulnerabilities may have combat implications as well as an effect on roleplay
that you can leverage. If a Player has the Wanted Vulnerability, you can have
the faction that is hunting them appear in an Adventure. They might
explicitly approach the Players as hostile, attempting to engage in combat,
or the Players might have an opportunity to talk their way out of the
situation if they choose, or attack the enemies themselves.  

#### Setting up Combat Encounters

You decide what types of Combat Encounters you want to run during a session.
There are many different ways to run Combat, and mixing it up regularly is a
good way to keep it interesting for the Players.

Do you want to pit the Players against a single strong foe, who can stand
toe-to-toe with the entire 3-6 Player team in a Combat? Or do you want to
throw many smaller enemies with a single stronger foe they are supporting, in
a larger-scale battle scene? The choice is yours - and often a session may
have a mix of combat encounters. 

It is recommended for a session to include a mix of roleplay and combat,
though depending on the scenario the Encounters may be more combat focused.
Storming an enemy fortress, for example, may result in several Combat
Encounters that are fought closely together, while investigating a crime in a
major city may have more social investigation-based roleplay with only one or
two combat Encounters. 

### Dealers, Minions, Bystanders, and Companions

- *Minions* are enemies that are weaker than the Players. They often have
   lower HP, and they cannot take Powers or Vulnerabilities. Minions do not
   have access to Fate Cards, and as the GM you would draw from a shared deck
   of cards whenever Minions are present.

- *Dealers* are as powerful if not more powerful than the Players. They are
   the movers and shakers of the world, and often command Minions on the
   battlefield. GMs draw from a separate deck of cards on behalf of each
   Dealer, and these Dealers can use Fate Cards. Each Dealer starts with one
   Fate Card, and reserves Aces when drawn. Dealers can also take Powers and
   Vulnerabilities, and may be in possession of powerful items and equipment.
   See below for how to turn a Dealer into a Boss. 

- *Bystanders* are allied or neutral characters that exist throughout the
   world. Bystanders range from simple store owners and local innkeepers, to
   ambassadors or nobles from a neighboring land. These characters are
   typically on par in power with Minions, though some Bystanders are
   considerably more powerful and can join the Players in combat as
   Companions or GM controlled Dealers.

- *Companions* are Player controlled creatures that are allied to the Players.
   They can be commanded with an Action, and Players can invest in Powers
   that make their Companion more powerful. You can grant the Players a
   temporary Companion as part of an Adventure, which does not cost XP, but
   the most common way for Players to get a Companion is to take a relevant
   Power on Level Up. As the GM, you decide whether or not a Bystander will
   join the Players as a Companion, and for how long. This might involve a Check, or an exchange of money or items. 

### Creating a Boss Encounter

Certain Dealers are extremely powerful, and gain additional benefits and
Actions that are not present in other types of Encounters. Any Dealer could
be considered a Boss, and GMs are encouraged to make use *Adversary Actions*
whenever a Dealer is present to make them feel more threatening. Adding
in *House Actions* during a Boss Encounter can create a dynamic and exciting
Encounter that will challenge the Players.

Boss Encounters are best saved for the end of Adventures, as a culmination of the
work the Players have done up to that point. As the GM, you can choose when
to place a Boss Encounter in your Adventure, as well as what Actions they should
have based on when and where they are fought.    

#### Adversary Actions

An Adversary Action is a unique mechanic to an enemy Dealer, and can be used
between any character's turns. Adversary Actions help balance encounters
where a single Dealer might be facing a group of 3-6 Players. Adding in
Adversary Actions helps balance an Encounter where the Players may be facing
a single Dealer or a small group and a single Dealer. Using Adversary Actions
helps give the Players a sense of the power and danger of a single enemy. 

Some Adversary Actions may be related to resource replenishment, like allowing
a Dealer to recover a small amount of HP or gain AP. Other Adversary Actions
allow for an additional attack, or affect the environment to make the Players
make a Check. If the Players fail that Check, they might take damage or
receive a Status Condition like Entangled. 

Here is an example Adversary Action that a poison wielding enemy might use: 
- Acid Splash, a cloud of acid appears in a 4 space cube. Any creature within
  the cloud when it appears must make a DR 3 Agility Check. On a failure,
  take 2 damage. On a success, take half damage.   

#### House Actions

If a Boss Encounter is happening within the Dealer's home or base of operations,
an additional mechanic is added known as House Actions. These are Actions
that happen at the beginning of every round of combat during a Boss Encounter.
Once every Dealer and Minion has made their turn, and the first character in
the turn order would go again, a House Action can trigger. This is a great
way to add in dynamic elements to an encounter, such as new enemies appearing
or a Phase change for a Boss. Some House Actions can be randomized by
creating a table of possibilities, and drawing a card at the top of every
round. 

Think about the Boss you are trying to create. Would there be more Minions
nearby, ready to be summoned by the call of their Master? Or does their lair
contain traps or other hidden secrets that could be exposed during the course
of a longer battle. Get creative with it!  

#### Boss Phases

Dealers often have less than 10 total HP to keep the amount of damage Players
can do balanced at numbers below 10. Boss Encounters, however, can have
multiple Phases where the Dealer changes their approach each time they run
out of HP, and replenish their HP at the beginning of each Phase. Every time a Boss enters a new Phase, draw a new TC for them.

When designing a Boss Encounter, determine the total amount of HP you want the
Boss to have. Then divide this up into Phases where the Boss has less than 10
HP per Phase. Once their HP reaches 0, you can trigger the start of the next
Phase where they regain their total HP once again and advance to the next
Phase. Make sure to keep track of which Phase the Boss is in during the
Encounter. 

These are a few examples of Boss Phases you could add in that change the
Encounter over time. Experiment with these and feel free to try out different Phase mechanics.

After dropping to 0 HP for the first time, the Boss might: 

- Summon Minions 
- Escape to another location 
- Disappear when minions spawn, and reappear when they've been defeated 
- Disappear when minions spawn, and reappear after a set number of rounds 
- Alter the environment (breathe fire,
   spread ice, displace rock, or create air currents/cyclones) 
- Modify their core stats or Skill Modifiers
- Change their AR 
- Start drawing with Upper Hand 

### Example Combat Encounter designed for 4 Players at level 2

Here is an example encounter that you could run with your Players. In a longer
campaign, it is recommended that you mix it up with different types of
encounters to see how the Players react and interact with each other. This
will keep things fresh so combat keeps Players engaged over time.

Lore is kept purposefully blank - feel free to fill it in with the world or archetype you
are most interested in. 

Below are suggested stats and abilities for each of the enemies, though as the
GM you are free to modify or tweak as you see fit. 

#### Location and Spacing

For this encounter, you want a wide open space for the Players and enemies to
move around in. Look for a generic battle map, between 10-20 spaces across.
This allows for movement and range to come into play in a meaningful way,
which adds to the complexity of the encounter. 

#### Encounter Details and Setup

The Encounter contains 1 Dealer and 4 Minions. The enemy Dealer should be
positioned farther away from the Players at first, with the two Guards up
closest to the Players and the Shooters positioned between 3-5 spaces away
from the Dealer each. This will force the Players to choose their targets and
allows for space between each enemy. The Players will need to deal with the
Guards first in order to reach the Dealer, and gives the Dealer time to use
their abilities in the first two rounds before the Minions are fully
defeated.
