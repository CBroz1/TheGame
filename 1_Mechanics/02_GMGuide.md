## Introduction

As the Game Master (GM), your task is to bring together a group of Players and guide
them through an Adventure. An Adventure can last for a single 2-3 hour session,
or it can unfold over the course of weeks, months, or even years in a continuous
narrative. You can bring together close friends in person, or find new friends
virtually through the [Discord](https://discord.gg/2Wu6ZAb6S9).

If you’ve been a GM elsewhere and are hoping to learn about what’s
different about being a Deck of Adventures Game Master, you can skip right to
[Being a Deck of Adventures Game Master](#Being-a-Deck-of-Adventures-Game-Master). 
For everyone else, or
those GMs who want a refresher, we will dive into what being a GM
is all about in 
[Getting Started as a Game Master](#Getting-Started-as-a-Game-Master). 

If you or your players have questions or need a helping hand, please reach out
to the team on [Discord](https://discord.gg/2Wu6ZAb6S9) or via GitHub issues.


## Getting Started as a Game Master

<!-- 
Needs a notes about 
  1. what a GM screen is, literally and metaphorically 
  2. checks - why this is how ppl interact with the world, why add randomness?
  3. resource management - move up from DofA specific. Flow state is achieved when we're
     at the peak of our ability and met with the exact level of challenge to fit our 
     skills. To keep players engaged, dial in the difficulty to where they're feeling
     challenged in a way that suits their play style, without worrying about what they 
     have left.
-->

Game Masters (GMs) play referee and narrator in a Tabletop RPG like Deck of
Adventures (DofA). You are both the arbiter of the rules, and the actor/playwright 
who brings the various scenes of the story to life and voices the
majority of the characters who populate the world. You control when certain
characters come and go, scene changes, and the
narration between scenes. 

GMs are responsible for preparing ahead of sessions and
guiding a group of Players through a collaborative narrative
Adventure. You bring the game to life with
any type of story you can imagine. There are so many possibilities as 
Game Master.

There are many different approaches GMs take to this role, focusing on unique
strengths and talents. Don't compare yourself to others,
especially those with years of experience. This craft
takes years to hone, and decades to master, but you can be a great GM
within your first few sessions by following some of the advice in this guide. 
The DofA Community
also is available to respond to questions and offer advice, drawing from years of collective
experience. 

<!-- moved up from below --> 
You should be an impartial force in the world, controlling both allies and
enemies neutrally. The best sessions feel like
everyone is working together to complete an objective, even the GM, rather
than competition between Players and GM. 
This is a delicate balance, and GMs should ask for
Players' feedback. It's also a GM's
responsibility to provide feedback to the Players at the table when necessary,
especially if one's play style may be a distraction to others at the table. 

As a GM, you will need to spend time outside of normal
session hours working on your Adventure. You will be 
the primary resource for information about the world. 
Players will ask questions, and it's up to you to provide details, even if
it's improvised. It's also OK to say you don't know something, or that you'll need
to get back to them after the session. You should 
open to Player questions and ideas, and work with them to tell the
story rather, as much as possible. 
Improvisation and
spontaneity are two vital ingredients to a great session,
but having key moments mapped out is important to shaping the Players' experience. 
What you prepare may not pan out perfectly, and that's part of the fun. 
The Players bring their own creative agency, and 
can be unpredictable. It's important not to
force the players back into a prescribed narrative. 
If the Players logically lead the
the session in a different direction, go with it. 
The Players also may not know when story beats are improvised, but these can be
the most organic and memorable Adventures. The GM
builds the world, populates it with characters and history, and then the
Players walk through that world and experience it first-hand. 


## Being a Deck of Adventures Game Master

As a Deck of Adventures (DofA) Game Master (GM) you are controlling the flow of card draws
on both sides of the table.

### Game Master Resources

Game Masters (GMs) should have at least two decks of cards available during a session to
represent allies and enemies. More decks may be useful to represent different
groups. If you only have one deck available, split it into
two 26-card decks and shuffle regularly. 

Most NPCs won't stick around long enough to use a deck completely, and 
won't shuffle prematurely, invoking Lower Hand. For the
exceptional NPC, try assigning them a deck, if available. If 
unavailable, you can decide when to invoke Lower Hand behind the GM screen.

### Managing Player Resources

Adventures can also be designed to test different
aspects of the Players and characters. Each Player holds a single deck of 52
cards, with two Fate Cards reserved at the beginning of play. Each character
has statistics that include total Health Points (HP), Fate Points (FP), and
Armor Points (AP). 

### Cards

Players' decks are like their character's stamina. As cards are drawn,
they should get progressively more tired throughout the day via Checks and Powers.
At lower levels, Players may not reach the end of their decks
between Rests to incur Lower Hand penalties. As Players
level up, both the Powers they use and the Encounters they face
may require more draws, bringing them closer to running out. 

### Resting

Health and Fate Points are also balanced by Rests. Players should 
take 1-2 Quick Rests between Full Rests during each day of in-game
time, depending on the Encounters they face. While Resting, the Players will
be regaining their HP and FP, and expending Rest Cards. 
When planning Encounters that deal damage, keep these resources in mind.
Try to keep Players motivated to press on, even without full resources. 
They may want to take a Quick Rest p if their HP or FP drop too low. 

To Rest, Players will consult with the GM about whether it is
feasible for their characters to secure a 30-minute or 8-hour break uninterrupted
If a situation is tense, it may not always be possible to gain the benefits of a Rest. 
In the event that a Rest is interrupted, it can be resumed
based on the remaining time left and extended as necessary. 
For example, a Full Rest would be easy to secure at a
comfortable inn in a major city. 
A temporary hiding spot in an enemy bandit camp would me much more risky. 
You could use (a) a Player stealth Check (b) an enemy detection Check, or (c) an Epic 
Event to see if they are interrupted. 
As the GM, you have the ultimate authority in the successful completion of a
Rest. Encourage players to 
work with each other to make the best decision given circumstances.

### Working with Character Vulnerabilities

Each character can have one or two (or more)
Vulnerabilities, which may have
mechanical and/or roleplay implications. GMs are highly
encouraged to keep these Vulnerabilities in mind when designing 
Adventures. For Players, these are narrative seeds that can be cultivated
to result in truly meaningful moments for the Players. 

For Player Vulnerabilities with more severe mechanical consequences, or those
that could lead to dangerous situations, GMs should
avoid planning too much on this weakness. The Players should feel like
their Vulnerabilities add to the richness of the story, and ultimately rewarded
for taking on the challenge. A Vulnerability should result in feeling a
balance of toughness and heroism despite the odds. At its best,
Vulnerabilities will inspire characters that 
develop over time, intertwining with a broader narrative.

For NPCs, Vulnerabilities can add depth to an otherwise flat archetype 
of merchant or farmer. Are there Vulnerabilities that can work 
to challenge the values of Players? What foils can help Players flesh out their 
character by disagreeing with another. Seeing a corruptible guard might really activate
a character focused on justice. Enemy NPC Vulnerabilities also give Players something
to exploit, though deeper analysis of the world. Yes, one Player can do consistent 
damage by continuing to attack, but another could spend a turn studying movements to
learn that their adversary has an injury and can't defend against specific attacks.
Perhaps an enemy has specific values that could be used to turn them into an ally.

### Creating Your World

`MISSING`

<!-- BROZ: How much here should be in DofA-specific? Feels like new-GM topic to me -->

## Running a Session with Deck of Adventures

### The Target Card System

As a Game Master (GM), you will set up various challenges wherein
you or a Player
will draw a Target Card (TC), and the other draws against that card to make a Check.
The level of difficulty of a Check is set by the Difficulty Range (DR),
which is the distance between pip values that will still count as a success. 
The Target Card System is circular, so an Ace is only 1 away from
both a King and a 2. 

| DR   | -6  | -5  | -4  | -3  | -2  | -1  | 0   | +1  | +2  | +3  | +4  | +5  | +6  |
|---:  |:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Card | 8   | 9   | 10  | J   | Q   | K   | A   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   |

### Successes and Failures

- **Successes** happen when the drawn card is within the DR. 
  The character making the Check is able to accomplish what they intended, within reason.

- **Misses** happen when the drawn card is outside the DR.
  The character making the Check is not able to accomplish what they intended. 

- **Critical Successes** happen when the drawn card exactly matches the TC in 
  pip value and suit. At 1.9% chance, they should feel amazing
  for the Player. Make an effort to rewards these exact matches whenever possible
  with additional effects or bonuses.

- **Major Successes** happen when the drawn card matches the TC in pip value 
  At 7.7% chance, this should feel pretty
  good. In Combat, a Major Success increases the
  damage of the attack by 1. Out of combat, some smaller bonus should happen whenever 
  possible.

- **Color and Suited Successes** happen when the drawn card is within the DR and 
  matches the TC in color or suit. 

- **Fate Cards**  permit a Dealer (Player character or significant NPC) to redraw. If
  this changes the success state, the first draw should be ignored.

<!-- 
    BROZ: Previously, on Fate Cards: This is treated as a regular Success. 
          This implies the second draw can't crit. I'm not sure I would want that.
-->

### Likelihood Chart

The chart below shows probability of success for the most frequent draws at each
Difficulty Range (DR). 
To further dial in the difficulty, you might say that a specific check requires a 
Color or Suited Success. 
Note that Color or Suit make success half or a quarter as likely. 
Some mechanics or GM rulings can call for checks to be made at Upper or Lower hand, 
drawing (up to) 2 or more cards, and taking the more or less benefitial result.
The final row notes the difference caused 
by drawing 2 cards. At DR 0 or 6, there's little difference, but it can be
as much as 25% for
a DR 3 check.

| DR          | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6    |
|------------:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:| :---:|
| Normal Draw | 8%  | 23% | 38% | 54% | 69% | 85% | 100% |
| Color Draw  | 4%  | 12% | 19% | 27% | 35% | 42% | 50%  |
| Suit Draw   | 2%  | 6%  | 10% | 13% | 17% | 21% | 25%  |
| Lower Hand 2| 1%  | 5%  | 15% | 29% | 48% | 72% | 100% |
| Upper Hand 2| 15% | 41% | 62% | 79% | 91% | 98% | 100% |
| Difference  |  7% | 18% | 24% | 25% | 21% | 13% | NA   |

### Fate Cards

Players start with their 2 Jokers and will randomly gain Fate
Cards as they draw their Aces. As a GM, you can promote using Fate Cards by
give more to reward key moments of play. This can
be a great tool for encouraging great roleplay or working together. 

### Skills Breakdown

Players will want to make Checks based on their characters' strengths. Their
approach to a situation should determine the nature of a check. As the GM,
you have the final say as to which skill applies. Attributes are
meant to be more responsive/reactive, and are often used for Contested
Checks. Skills are intended to be more active for character-initiated events.

The list below provides of general information about the Attributes and Skills (see
[Full Players Guide](../01_PlayerGuide_Full.md#Characters) 
for more info).

<!-- BROZ: Do you want links to go to github or the site? I replaced with a relative
           doc link, which should work on both, not certain -->

- AGL Agility: Dodging Contested Checks, boosts Unarmored AC.
    - Finesse: Performing difficult actions with ease. Primary Skill for Martial role.
    - Stealth: Moving quietly, undetected.

- CON Conviction: Strength of character to resist harmful mental effects.
    - Bluffing: Convincing others, either truthfully or deceptively.
    - Performance: Acting under scrutiny, potentially in front of audiences.

- GUT Intuition: Gut feelings about the state of the world (e.g., truthfulness, 
  supernatural knowledge)
    - Detection: Observing the world using all senses.
    - Craft: Practicing a honed trade (i.e., Medicine, Pottery, Piety). 
      Primary Skill for Support role.

- INT Intelligence: Reactive critical thinking or recalling recalling explicit information.
    - Knowledge: Recalling and amassing knowledge at leisure. Primary Skill for Casters.
    - Investigation: Seeking the answer a question or piecing together information.

- STR Strength: Physical limits and boundaries (e.g,. resisting a push).
    - Athletics: Exerting oneself in physical sustained challenge.
    - Brute: Burst force or single lifts. Primary Skill for Defenders. 

- VIT Vitality: Resisting bodily harm. Determines max HP.

### Contested Checks

Contested Checks are initiated when two characters attempt to
accomplish opposite goals, or one character attempting to overcome the resistance of 
another (see 
[Full Player Guide](../01_PlayerGuide_Full.md#contested-checks) for more info).

The list below features some examples, but, as the GM, it's up to you to decide what
a situation calls for if it is not explicitly described in the manual or in a Power
mechanic.

1. Tackle Target: Initiator Finesse vs. Target Athletics 
2. Convince Target, truthfully or deceptively: Initiator Bluffing vs. Target Detection 
3. `MISSING`

### Epic Events

<!-- BROZ: I think this could be revised referring back to the same example repeatedly
           the way I did for the player guide successes.
 -->

Epic Events are unique, time-gated scenarios that can occur throughout an
Adventure. As the Game Master (GM), you determine when an Epic Event will happen,
set the Difficulty, and decide the stakes. 

Epic Events invoke a specific set
of rules for determining the outcome, which is different than traditional
combat, social interaction, or exploration. These are typically very draining on 
Player stamina (remaining decks), and could be a tool to engage resource management.
This is also is a good way to engage all
Players in faster-paced, more free-form roleplaying. Since
Players can't make a Check two times in a row, it requires active dialogue,
planning, and participation from every Player.

For more information on Epic Events, visit the [Full Player Guide](https://github.com/DeckofAdventures/TheGame/blob/main/1_Mechanics/01_PlayerGuide_Full.md#Epic-Events)

#### How to Identify an Epic Event

<!-- BROZ: I think Epic could also be used for time skips. Do we want to first-person
           this long treck from A to B or Epic it? Or replace the 2-year gap training 
           montage
-->

Epic Events often occur within a limited time frame, typically
less than a minute, and typically no more than twice per session. This could be a
fleeing event under some thread of harm (e.g., a crumbling dungeon or
an erupting volcano), or an unexpected smaller scenario (e.g., preventing an 
uncontrolled vehicle from crashing). It can cover a small scope (e.g, a moment of 
surprise that begins a larger battlefield), something larger (e.g., replace an entire
combat), or even be used to shrink time skips (e.g., dealing with the storms and 
resource management of travel across a sea). As GM, you
will get a feel for what makes for a good Epic Event, and how to place it in
your narrative to keep the session feeling fresh and lively for all of your
Players.


#### Setting an Epic Event's Difficulty

The GM sets the difficulty ahead by announcing how many 
Successes will be needed before 3 Failures. 
Setting an a difficulty of 4 means that the Players need to
make 4 successful Checks before reaching 3 failures. 

#### Deciding the Stakes

Going into an Epic Event, there is no guarantee of Success, even
at lower Difficulties. Try to balance the outcomes based on the scope of the
Epic Event. Not all Epic Events are life-or-death scenarios, and consequences
can vary depending on the number of success before 3 failures. 

If Players get 3 Failures trying to escape a collapsing dungeon, they may
take a little damage or need to discard some cards, or lose a precious object in the 
fray. 
Likewise, if the Players are successful without any failures, the
reward for their success can be balanced accordingly. 

<!-- MISSING - a table or reference of standard success/failures + example
 stakes for certain types of scenarios --> 

#### An Example of an Epic Event

<!-- BROZ: Is this the 'classic' example? I feel like the dungeon collapse or sneaky 
           infiltration does the concept more justice bc it's something that would be
           otherwise handled by less intense skill checks, instead of combat.
 -->

The Players hear screaming ~100 ft away, and rush to investigate. 
They see a group of townsfolk being attacked by a group of
monsters. Each of the townsfolk is engaged with a different monster. The difficulty
is set to 3, and 5 target cards are drawn. The Players then declare which
skill they will use to save one of the townsfolk, and must make a suited hit
before the GM does to succeed on each TC. 

- The Defender chooses Brute, and intends to ram into a monster while
  the townsperson gets away. The GM decides a corresponding DR of 3 
  on a 9 of Hearts Target Card (TC). The Defender draws a 6 of Hearts
  and, with the Defender's +2 to Brute, this is a Suited Success and a success on 
  the first Epic Event challenge. 

- The Support wants to protect a townsperson using their magic via Craft, with a +1
  modifier. The GM rules this more difficult, with a DR 2 on a 7
  of Clubs TC. The Support draws a 3 of Diamonds, which is a miss. The GM then
  draws, without a modifier, against this same TC. They draw a 6 of Spades; 
  also a miss. Support and GM each take turns drawing until until the Support
  draws a 5 of Clubs, which is a success. 

- The Martial wants to sneak up to a monster and help the townsperson escape, 
  using Stealth. The GM sets a DR 2 on the
  Jack of Spades TC. The Martial draws first, and misses. The GM draws a King of
  Spades. As the GM got a Suited Success, this is the first failure for the Players.

- The Caster and Support both go for the fourth TC together, each with their
  primary skill modifier. The DR is set to a 3, and they each draw first,
  missing the TC. The GM draws, and misses. The Caster misses again, but uses
  a Fate Card to re-draw and draws a suited hit. This marks a 3rd success for
  the Players, which ends the Epic Event.

The Players watch as the monsters retreat, having saved the majority of the
townsfolk. Due to the one failure, one of the townsfolk has been gravely
injured and was dragged away with the monsters as they retreated. The Players
can choose to follow after the monsters or regroup with the townsfolk they
saved. This might
result in a reward from the local government for saving lives, or kick off a
new Adventure that involves seeking out the monsters.

### Combat

<!-- BROZ: This feels like new-GM stuff -->
Deck of Adventures (DofA) combat is meant to be fast-paced, collaborative, and
accessible. It is designed around a simple core, while allowing for a lot of
player freedom based on how they built their character. 
To run combat in DofA successfully, you should plan encounters
thoughtfully and be able to adapt on the fly when Players make unexpected
strategic decisions. 

Some sessions may be very focused on combat, with 3-4
combat encounters between Full Rests, while others will be more roleplay-oriented.
As the Game Master (GM),
you decide what mix is best for your table. Some Players may be more interested
in combat, while others get excited and engaged with good social roleplay, and it
is up to you as the GM to balance the interests of the Players at the table.

#### Initiating Combat

You choose when to declare the beginning of Combat, and this triggers the
start of Combat Turn Order. The start depends entirely on the
scenario. It might begin when the Players decide to attack an enemy, or when
an enemy decides to attack the Players. 

To determine Turn Order, every Player will draw a Target Card for themselves. 
As the GM, you will draw a TC for each Minion and Dealer involved in the
Encounter, including any new enemies that appear throughout Combat. 
To simplify, a group of
Minions might have a single TC, but a A Dealer must always have their own
TC.

#### Strengths and Weaknesses

There are ways to build encounters that allow the Players to highlight their
character's strengths or Vulnerabilities. 
If a Player recently took a new Power, you might build an
encounter give it a chance to shine. An new area of effect 
Power would be feel great to deploy on a swarm of smaller enemies.
If a Player has the Wanted Vulnerability, you introduce the
the faction hunting, who might
approach the Players as hostile. Can the Players
talk their way out of the
situation?

<!-- BROZ Move up to new-GM  -->

#### Setting up Combat Encounters

You decide what types of Combat Encounters you want to run during a session.
Players could be matched against a single strong foe. Many smaller enemies
might have the players torn in different directions. 
A single Dealer with supporting Minions might have interesting interaction effects,
where one gains benefits in the presence of the other.

GMs should try to include a mix of roleplay and combat, when possible.
Storming an enemy fortress may result in several Combat
Encounters back to back. Investigating a crime in a
major city may have more social investigation-based with relatively little combat.

<!-- BROZ Move up to new-GM  -->

### Character Types

- **Minions** are enemies that are weaker than the Players. They often have
   lower HP, and cannot take Powers or Vulnerabilities. They do not
   have access to Fate Cards, and draw from a single GM deck.

- **Dealers** are just as powerful, or more powerful than, than the Players. They are
   have a name, and experience that would lend them power. 
   GMs might draw from a separate deck of cards for each
   Dealer. Each starts with one
   Fate Card, and reserves Aces when drawn. Dealers can also take Powers and
   Vulnerabilities, and may possess items.
   See below for how to turn a Dealer into a Boss. 

- **Bystanders** are allied or neutral characters that exist throughout the
   world, as anything from a store owner to
   noble ambassador. These characters are
   typically on par in power with Minions, and may be persuaded to
   join Players in combat as Companions or GM controlled Dealers.

<!-- BROZ: Do we Bystander distinction? Can't an NPC be either Dealer, Minion 
           or Companion, and join players in combat accordingly? -->

- **Companions** are Player-controlled creatures who 
   can be commanded with an Action. Players can invest in Powers
   to make their Companion more powerful. A GM might also grant a
   temporary Companion as part of an Adventure, potentially as a result of
   a Check, or an exchange for other money or items. 

- **Bosses** are even more powerful than dealers, and gain the following benefits:
  Adversary Actions, House Actions, and Phases. 

### Creating a Boss Encounter

Boss Encounters are best saved for the end of Adventures, as a culmination of the
the story thus far. As the GM, you choose what Actions have access to.

#### Adversary Actions

An Adversary Action is a Boss ability that takes place outside their turn
during Combat to help balance encounters
where a single Boss might be facing up to 6 Players. 
They
help Players feel a sense of danger from a single enemy. These may be
related to resource replenishment, like allowing
a Dealer to recover a small amount of HP or gain Fate Points. They may
allow for an additional attack, an environmental effect involving a Check for the Players.
Players who fail might take damage or
receive a Status Condition like Entangled. 

For example, a poisonous monster would have the following Adversary Action: 
*Acid Splash*. A cloud of acid appears in a 4 space cube. Any creature inside the cube
at the start of their turn makes a DR 3 Agility Check or take 2 
damage. On a success, 1 damage.

#### House Actions

House Actions take place when a Boss is in their home or base of operations.
Once initiated, they happen at the beginning of every round of combat.
This is a great
way to add in dynamic elements to an encounter, such as new enemies appearing
or the environment becoming more dangerous.

#### Boss Phases

Dealers often have < 10 HP. For balance, Boss Encounters can have
multiple Phases. After running out of HP, they replenish and changes their approach.
Every time a Boss enters a new Phase, draw a new TC for them. 
The following list features a number of examples that might be triggered by a new Phase:
<!-- BROZ: Why draw new TC -->

- Boss escapes to another location 
- Boss summons Minions 
- Boss alters the environment to make certain areas 
    + cause damage (e.g., erupting flame)
    + require a check (e.g,. Agility check to stay standing ice) 
- Boss disappears, and reappears
    - when Minions have been defeated 
    - after a set number of rounds 
    - after an environmental effect dissipates 
- Boss changes features like
    + core stats
    + higher or lower AR
    + drawing with Upper Hand (e.g., putting in more effort)
    + drawing with Lower Hand (e.g., getting angry/sloppy)

### Example Combat Encounter designed for 4 Players at level 2

<!-- BROZ: New GM stuff -->
In a longer
campaign, mix up the types of
encounters to see how Players react and interact with each other. This
will keep things fresh so combat keeps Players engaged over time.

Here, the context is kept purposefully blank to fill in with your setting.

**Location.** Start with a wide open space for the Players and enemies to
move around in, between 10-20 spaces across to
allow for movement and range inform tactics. 

**Setup.** Add 4 Minions close to the entrance and 1 Dealer
farther away. 2 Minions are melee guards
and 2 are shooters 3-5 spaces away, to
force the Players to choose their targets and
allow space between each enemy. The Players will need to deal with Minions
Guards first in order to reach the Dealer, giving the Dealer to use
their abilities in the first 2+ rounds. 

<!-- BROZ: editing bookmark -->
