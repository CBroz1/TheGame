# Deck of Adventures Core Mechanics

## Quick-Start Guide

Your Game Master (GM) is about to play narrator to a story in which you will take part.
The GM will be there to help you through the process, but the more you pick up, the
more time the GM can spend crafting an amazing story with you as participant.

1. Grab a deck of playing cards, exclude Jokers, and shuffle well.
2. You may be asked to make a Check. This involves..
   - A *Target Card* (TC) on the table, that you hope to be close to when you Draw.
   - *Difficulty Range* (DR) that defines how far away from the TC you can be and still
     succeed.
   - A DR 'above' a King is an Ace, then 2, looping back around. A DR below 2 is Ace,
     then King.
   - A *Modifier* (Mod) provided by your character sheet, that allows you to add or 
     subtract
     from the card you draw to get closer to the TC.
   - Sometimes, you'll be asked to draw more than one card to increase (Upper Hand) or 
     decrease (Lower Hand) your odds.
   - For example, on a TC of 4, with a DR 1, you would need either a 3, 4, or 5. If you 
     have a +1 Mod, you can draw a 2 or 6 and still report a 3 or 5 draw.
3. You start with 2 Jokers in your hand as *Fate Cards*. Any Aces drawn during play are 
also reserved as Fate Cards. At any time, you can discard a Fate Card to redraw and take the new 
value.
4. You should have a character sheet with Attributes (general skills, like Agility and
Intelligence), and specific Skills under each attribute (e.g., Finesse under Agility).
Each Attribute and Skill has a Modifier that you add when drawing a card related to that
Attribute or Skill.
5. Also on your character sheet are *Powers*. This is anything your character can do
that might not be accessible to others. Some Powers, labeled Minor and Major, take 1 or
2 *Energy Points* respectively. Your character sheet shows your starting number as your
maximum. You'll need to keep track of how many you have left.
6. The GM will describe a scene. It's up to you to ask follow-up questions and figure
out what your character would do. Creativity and thinking outside the box (i.e., exact
rules) is encouraged.
7. The GM might announce an *Epic Event*.
   - You'll draw 5 cards and for an unknown number of checks for all players.
   - You and the other players will work together to pass the checks, with the added
     option of being able to sacrifice addional cards to increase your Mod by 1 for
     each card sacrificed.
   - If your character needs a rest to recharge their Energy Points or heal, this is
   played as an Epic event with either 3 cards for a short rest or 5 cards for a long
   rest.
8. After a long rest, shuffle your discard pile back into your deck. 
   - If you run out of cards before you can rest, you may shuffle and always draw with 
     the Lower Hand, making it harder to succeed. 
   - On a long rest, add the Jokers to your hand as Fate Cards if they aren't there 
     already.
9. If your group turns to violence to solve issues, the DM will announce the beginning 
of Combat, where you draw cards to determine turn order.
   - You can move and take up to 2 actions, in any order. A second action is made with
     Lower Hand.
   - Your movement is limited by the speed value on your character sheet, showing the |
     maximum number of spaces you can move on a grid. 
   - Your character sheet will give you optional actions take under Powers, but you can
     always try something new.
   - If you get hit, you can expend a Fate card to avoid 1 damage.
   - Depending on the type of attack or amount of damage, you may get Stunned, Knocked
     Out, Blinded/Deafened or Entangled, and need to undo this effect
10. Remember: having fun comes first.
