# Deck of Adventures Core Mechanics

## Quick-Start Guide

Your Game Master (GM) is about to play narrator to a story in which you will take part. The GM will be there to help you through the process, but the more you pick up, the more time the GM can spend crafting an amazing story with you as participant.

1. Grab a deck of playing cards, exclude Jokers, and shuffle well.
2. When asked, you'll draw one card from this deck, add a *Modifier*, and report the total. Sometimes, you'll be asked to draw more than one.
   - Sometimes your total will pass a *Difficulty Check* (DC) threshold, sometimes not.
   - Success and failure are both part of an interesting story.
3. If you draw a King or Ace, this is a *Fate Card* and should stay in your hand. If not, put it in your discard pile.
   - At any time, you can discard a Fate Card to redraw and take the new value.
   - When Aces are used in this way, add an extra 5 to the total.
4. You should have a character sheet with Attributes (general skills, like Agility and Intelligence), and specific Skills under each attribute (like Reflex and Finesse under Agility). Each Attribute and Skill has a Modifier that you add when drawing a card related reasons.
5. The GM will describe a scene. It's up to you to ask follow-up questions and figure out what your character would do. Creativity and thinking outside the box (i.e., exact rules) is encouraged.
6. The GM might announce an *Epic Event*.
  - You'll draw 5 cards and for an unknown number of checks for all players.
  - You and the other players will work together to pass the checks, with the added option of being able to sum cards.
  - If your character needs a rest to recharge spells or heal, this is played as an Epic event with either 3 cards for a short rest or 5 cards for a long rest.
7. If your group turns to violence to solve issues, the DM will announce the beginning of Combat, where you draw cards to determine turn order.
   - You can move (up to six spaces on a grid, if present) and take up to 3 actions, in any order.
   - The more actions you take, the harder they will be complete.
   - Your character sheet will give you standard actions to take, but you can always try something new.
   - If you get hit, you can expend a Fate Card to avoid damage.
   - Depending on the type of attack or amount of damage, you may get Stunned, Knocked Out, Blinded/Deafened or Entangled, and need to pass a check to get back to normal.
8. Remember: having fun comes first.
