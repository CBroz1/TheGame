# Deck of Adventures Core Mechanics

## What is Deck of Adventures? 

Deck of Adventures is a Tabletop Roleplaying Game (TTRPG) where you and your friends tell a collaborative narrative story together at the table. It is recommended you read the Full Players Guide to learn all of the rules, mechanics, and story-telling devices that are used to describe how characters interact with the world during a session of Deck of Adventures. 

A standard game of Deck of Adventures can be played with 3-6 players in person or virtually, and one player takes the role of the Game Master (GM) who uses the rules of the Deck of Adventures game system to set the stage
for a narrative that all players collectively move forward with their character's decisions and actions. Moment-to-moment, the GM
presents a scenario and players respond by attempting actions, either specified by the
game system or wholly invented. The GM determines a playerâ€™s success and failure, and
guides the group in a meaningful way.

## Quick-Start Guide

Your Game Master (GM) is about to play narrator to a story in which you will take part.
The GM will be there to help you through the process, but the more you pick up, the
more time the GM can spend crafting an amazing story with you as participant.

1. Grab a deck of playing cards, reserving the Jokers, and shuffle well.
2. Your GM will describe a scene. They may ask you to make a Check to determine the success or failure of an action your character is attempting that is more difficult than simply walking or talking. This might be attempting to sneak past an unsuspecting guard, trying to convince another character of something, or attacking an enemy. Making a Check involves...
   - A *Target Card* (TC) that is drawn and shown on the table, that you hope to be close to when you Draw. Think of it as the bullseye of the target you are aiming for.
   - *Difficulty Range* (DR) that defines how far away from the TC you can be and still
     succeed. Think of it as the closest rings surrounding the bullseye. A DR 'above' a 
     King is an Ace, then 2, and so on. A DR 'below' 2 is an Ace, then King, etc.
   - A *Modifier* (Mod) provided by your character sheet, that allows you to add or 
     subtract
     from the card you draw to get closer to the TC. This helps you aim your Check closer to the bullseye.
   - Sometimes, you'll be asked to draw more than one card to increase (Upper Hand) or 
     decrease (Lower Hand) your odds. This represents how difficult or easy a Check is to make.
   - For example, on a TC of 4, with a DR 1, you would need either a 3, 4, or 5 to succeed on a Check. If you 
   have a +1 Mod, you can draw a 2 or 6 and still report a successful 3 or 5 draw.
3. You start with 2 Jokers in your hand as *Fate Cards*. Any Aces drawn during play are 
also reserved as Fate Cards. At any time, you can discard a Fate Card to redraw and take the new 
value, or you can discard a Fate Card during combat to nullify a single point of damage your character would take.
4. You will have a Character Sheet that contains information about the character you are playing. On that sheet will be Attributes (general skills, like Agility and
Intelligence), and specific Skills under each attribute (e.g., Finesse under Agility).
Each Attribute and Skill has a Modifier that you add when drawing a card related to that
Attribute or Skill, signified by a number like +1.
5. Also on your character sheet are *Powers*. This is anything your character can do
that might not be accessible to others. Some Powers, labeled Minor and Major, take 1 or
2 *Energy Points* respectively to activate. Your character sheet shows your starting number of Energy Points as your
maximum. You'll need to keep track of how many Energy Points you have left as you use Powers.
6. Throughout a session, your GM will describe scenes and may provide visual cues or props. It's up to you to ask follow-up questions and figure
out what your character would do. Creativity and thinking outside the box (i.e., exact
rules) is encouraged.
7. The GM might announce an *Epic Event*.
   - Each player involved in the Epic Event will draw 5 cards to attempt to pass an unknown number of checks as a group.
   - You and the other players will work together to pass the checks, with the added
     option of being able to sacrifice additional cards to increase your Mod by +1 for
     each card sacrificed.
8. Your character may need to take a rest during a session to recharge their Energy Points or heal their Health Points. You can take a *Quick Rest*, which takes about 30 minutes of in-game time, or a *Full Rest*, which is a full 8 hours of in-game time. 
  - On a *Quick Rest*, each player draws 3 cards and sums up the total value of those cards to determine how many Energy Points and Health Points your character regains. Face Cards and Aces retain their value (J=11, Q=12, K=13, A=14). Reference the Full Guide for more details on taking a *Quick Rest*.
  - On a *Full Rest*, shuffle your discard pile back into your deck. You also replenish all expended Energy Points and your Health Points return to their maximum. 
   - If you run out of cards before you can successfully take a *Full Rest*, you may shuffle and always draw with 
     the Lower Hand, making it harder to succeed. This signifies your character running out of Stamina during a long day. 
   - On a *Full Rest*, you may return both Jokers from the discard pile to your hand as Fate Cards if they were used. Return any Aces back to your deck before shuffling for a *Full Rest*.
9. If your group turns to violence to solve issues, the DM will announce the beginning 
of Combat, where each involved character will draw a Target Card to determine turn order.
   - On your turn, you can move and take up to 2 actions, in any order. Certain actions can only be used once per turn, unless otherwise specified by a Power.
   - Your movement is limited by the Speed value on your character sheet, showing the
     maximum number of spaces you can move on a grid. The average speed is 6. 
   - Your character sheet will give you optional actions that you can take listed under Powers, but you can
     always try something new. Work with your GM to determine whether an action is possible in the circumstances. 
   - If you get hit, you can expend a Fate card to nullify 1 point of damage.
   - Depending on the type of attack or amount of damage, you may get Stunned, Knocked
     Out, Blinded/Deafened or Entangled, and need to undo this effect. For a full list of effects and their rules, consult the Full Players Guide.
10. You're now ready to play your first game of Deck of Adventures! Remember: having fun comes first.
