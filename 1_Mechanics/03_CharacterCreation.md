# Character Creation

## Choose Your Background

First, choose where your character is coming from including your lived experiences that would motivate adventuring. Classically, this is a racial or species origin (e.g., Dwarves, Humans, or Elves of Fantasy) that fits with the GM's setting. Deck of Adventure offers many more backgrounds to choose from that could inspire your core concept. This has no inherent mechanical impact, but may shape how your character navigates challenges. Growing up at a seaport or a Dwarf, your character might be more adept at sailing or masonry (i.e., certain skill checks) than others.

## Choose Your Archetype

Your Archetype describes how your character navigates challenges. While a Knight might apply force, a Mage might find a more magical solution. Choosing an Archetype grants you access to specific upgrades, called Affinities. Each Archetype has a skill they use to attack in combat (e.g., Brute Strength or Knowledge). You can switch your Archetype later on, but must forfeit Affinities with that prerequisite in exchange for the points previously spent. 

## Choose your Primary Suit

Archetypes come primary suit suggestions, but this can be changed at each level-up.

- Diamonds‚ô¶Ô∏è : Fire  üî•, Offense    ü§õ
- Clubs   ‚ô£Ô∏è : Earth ü™®, Defense    üõ°
- Hearts  ‚ô•Ô∏è : Water üíß, Life       ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π
- Spades  ‚ô†Ô∏è : Air   üí®, Technology ‚ö°Ô∏è

Starting at level 2, Dealers are given special abilities based on their primary suit. First, they gain an additional modifier when pulling cards of that suit that increases with level (+1 at level 2). Second, they gain one of the following abilities that can be used a number of times equal to their level per long rest. Cards used in this manner are put directly in the discard pile without inspection.

- Diamonds‚ô¶Ô∏è : Fire or Offense Dealers have explosive damage but they reun out of gas really fast. They can choose to 'burn' up to 3 cards to add to their attack draw. 
- Clubs   ‚ô£Ô∏è : Earth or Defense Dealers have a strong foundation and can take the big hits. They can choose to 'bury' up to 3 cards to add to their AC.
- Hearts  ‚ô•Ô∏è : Water or Life Dealers are fluid and flexible to adapt the situation. If they are in the presence of an ally who fails a check, they may 'drown' up to 3 cards and add that number to their ally's draw.
- Spades  ‚ô†Ô∏è : Air or Technology Dealers have a special intutition and can take brief glimpses into the future. They can choose to 'blow' up to 3 cards to look at following cards in their action deck, equal to the number discarded. They return the viewed cards to their deck in the same order as before. 

## Choose Your Affinities

Affinities are your way of amplifying your character‚Äôs power both on and off the battlefield. These are additional perks and benefits to wielding certain types of weapons and magic and have both mechanical and roleplay implications. Some Affinities require a specific Archetype, prerequisite levels or relevant Attribute/Skill Modifiers.

## Choose Your Vulnerabilities

People are not perfect, and many have Vulnerabilities as a result of their relationship with the world. At character creation you can choose up to three Vulnerabilities, which add mechanical and roleplay implications, like being afraid of fire or unable to swim. Adding Vulnerabilities to your character will grant you additional Experience Points during character creation. Each Vulnerability added grants 1 or 2 Experience Points, but you can only gain 4 total Experience Points during character creation. A GM may overrule this limit if, for example, the events of the story result in a character gaining an additional Vulnerability.

## Using Experience Points

Both at character creation and at the GM's discretion for level ups, you are awarded Experience Points. These can be spent to gain additional Affinities, boost an Attribute, a Skill, add to the Spells you know, or remove a Vulnerability.

### Changing Attributes and Skills

You can adjust your Skills and Attributes using your Experience Points, which will help define how capable your character for relevant actions. On initial character creation, additional points can be gained from reducing modifier up to `X` for Attributes and `Y` for skills. Once these are set, a player may only add newly awarded Experience points.

All Attributes start at a +0 modifier. This modifier adds to all relevant skills. Raising an Attribute by 1 initially costs 2 Experience Points, but becomes more costly as you add. All Skills start at a -2 modifier. Raising a Skill by 1 costs 1 Experience Point, but becomes more costly as you add. Modifier maximums are regulated by skill level.
