# Character Creation

## Choose Your Background

First, choose where your character is coming from including your lived experiences that would motivate adventuring. Classically, this is a racial or species origin (e.g., Dwarves, Humans, or Elves of Fantasy) that fits with the GM's setting. Deck of Adventures offers many more backgrounds to choose from that could inspire your core concept. This has no inherent mechanical impact, but may shape how your character navigates challenges. Growing up at a seaport or a Dwarf, your character might be more adept at sailing or masonry (i.e., certain skill checks) than others.

## Choose Your Role

Your Role describes how your character navigates challenges. While a Defender might apply force, a Mage might find a more magical solution. Choosing an Role grants you access to specific upgrades, called Powers. Each Role has a skill they use to attack in combat (e.g., Brute Strength or Knowledge). You can switch your Role later on, but must forfeit Powers with that prerequisite in exchange for the points previously spent. 

- Defender
  - Description: Defenders can take a hit and keep protecting their allies. They focus more on battlefield control during combat than outright damage. Not someone to mess with!
  - Primary Skill: Brute
  - Suggested Suit: Clubs ‚ô£Ô∏è / Defense üõ°
- Support
   - Description: Attending to their allies, support characters may focus on healing or other boons to sway the battle in their favor. We're all stronger thanks to the support of our friends.
   - Primary Skill: Craft
   - Suggested Suit: Hearts ‚ô•Ô∏è / Life ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π
- Martial
   - Description: Martials move quick and hit hard. They're adept with physical weapons to directly damage enemeies. Agile and light on their feet!
   - Primary Skill: Finesse
   - Suggested Suit: Diamond ‚ô¶Ô∏è / Offense ü§õ
- Caster
   - Description: Casters can be mages of fantasy or techo-wizards of a much more mundane world. Their intelect drives them to skills the rest of us can barely comprehend.
   - Primary Skill: Knowledge
   - Suggested Suit: Spades ‚ô†Ô∏è / Technology ‚ö°Ô∏è

## Choose your Primary Suit

Roles come primary suit suggestions, but this can be changed at each level-up.

- Diamonds ‚ô¶Ô∏è : Offense    ü§õ
- Clubs    ‚ô£Ô∏è : Defense    üõ°
- Hearts   ‚ô•Ô∏è : Life       ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π
- Spades   ‚ô†Ô∏è : Technology ‚ö°Ô∏è

Starting at level 2, Dealers are given special abilities based on their primary suit. First, they gain an additional modifier when pulling cards of that suit. This modifier increases by one on each level-up. Second, they gain one of the following Suit Mechanics that can be used a number of times equal to their level per long rest. Cards used in this manner are put directly in the discard pile without inspection. The number of cards drawn in this manner serves as an additional modifier on a check before the outcome is known.

- Diamonds ‚ô¶Ô∏è : Offense Dealers have explosive damage but they reun out of gas really fast. They can choose to 'burn' up to 3 cards to add to their own attack draw. 
- Clubs    ‚ô£Ô∏è : Defense Dealers have a strong foundation and can take the big hits. They can choose to 'bury' up to 3 cards to add to their own AC until the start of their next turn.
- Hearts   ‚ô•Ô∏è : Life Dealers are fluid and flexible to adapt the situation. If they are in the presence of an ally who fails a check, they may 'Toss' up to 3 cards and add that number to their ally's draw.
- Spades   ‚ô†Ô∏è : Technology Dealers float around the battlefield and may deploy distractions against their enemies. They can 'scrap' up to 3 cards and subtract that number from an enemy draw.

## Choose Your Powers

Powers are your way of amplifying your character both on and off the battlefield. These are additional perks and benefits to wielding certain types of weapons and magic and have both mechanical and roleplay implications. Some Powers require a specific Role, prerequisite levels or relevant Attribute/Skill Modifiers.

Each Power has two properties: Size (Minor or Major) and Resource (Free or Costly). Size determines how many XP must be spent to add this Power. Minor Powers require 1 XP and Major Powers require 2 XP. Some Powers can be either Minor or Major, and will have improved effects as a Major Power. A character with a Major version of a Power may choose to use the Minor Power equivalent, but a character with a Minor Power does not have access to the Major effect. On level-up, a player may exchange 1 XP to convert a Minor Power to the Major equivalent.

Some powers require Resources. A Power is Free if it is always active, or can be used an unlimited number of times. Powers that are costly are tiresome and require Power Points to use. Your characters maximum Power Points are determined by the number of XP spent on Costly Powers. Minor Costly Powers cost 1 Power Point. Major Costly Powers cost 1 Power Point for the Minor effect, and 2 Power Points for the Major effect.

Unless otherwise noted, Powers that involve an attack take one action to perform and add a Dealer's Primary Skill Modifier. Unless otherwise noted, Powers with duration (e.g., an activated shield) may only be used one at a time. Using a second Power will cancel out the effects of the first.

## Choose Your Vulnerabilities

People are not perfect, and many have Vulnerabilities as a result of their relationship with the world. At character creation you can choose up to three Vulnerabilities, which add mechanical and roleplay implications, like being afraid of fire or unable to swim. Adding Vulnerabilities to your character will grant you additional Experience Points during character creation. Each Vulnerability added grants 1 or 2 Experience Points, but you can only gain 4 total Experience Points during character creation. A GM may overrule this limit if, for example, the events of the story result in a character gaining an additional Vulnerability.

## Using Experience Points

Both at character creation and at the GM's discretion for level ups, you are awarded Experience Points. These can be spent to gain additional Powers, boost an Attribute, a Skill, add to the Spells you know, or remove a Vulnerability.

### Changing Attributes and Skills

You can adjust your Skills and Attributes using your Experience Points, which will help define how capable your character for relevant actions. On initial character creation, you can spend points to increase Attributes and Modifiers up to +3. This cap increases depending on your level (2, +4; 3, +5; 5, +6). Once these are set at character creation, a player may only add newly awarded Experience points.

All Attributes and Skills start at a +0 modifier. The Attribute modifier adds to all relevant Skills. Raising an Attribute by 1 initially costs 2 Experience Points, but becomes more costly as you add. Raising a Skill by 1 costs 1 Experience Point, but becomes more costly as you add. Modifier maximums are capped according to character level (e.g., maximum +4 at level 1).
