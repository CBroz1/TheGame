# Character Creation

## Decide Your Background

First, choose where your character is coming from including your lived experiences that
would motivate adventuring. Classically, this is a 'racial' or species origin
(e.g., Dwarves, Humans, or Elves of Fantasy) that fits with the GM's setting. 
This has no inherent mechanical impact, but may shape how your character
navigates challenges. Growing up at a seaport or a Dwarf, your character might be more
adept at sailing or masonry (i.e., certain skill checks) than others.

## Choose Your Role

Your Role describes how your character navigates challenges. While a Defender might
apply force, a Caster might find a more magical solution. Choosing an Role grants you
access to specific upgrades, called Powers. Each Role has a skill they use to attack in
combat (e.g., Brute Strength or Knowledge). You can switch your Role later on, but must
forfeit Powers with that prerequisite in exchange for the points previously spent.

- Defender
  - Description: Defenders can take a hit and keep protecting their allies. They focus
  more on battlefield control during combat than outright damage. Not someone to mess
  with!
  - Primary Skill: Brute
  - Suggested Suit: Clubs ‚ô£Ô∏è / Defense üõ°
- Support
   - Description: Attending to their allies, support characters may focus on healing or
   other boons to sway the battle in their favor. We're all stronger thanks to the
   support of our friends.
   - Primary Skill: Craft
   - Suggested Suit: Hearts ‚ô•Ô∏è / Life ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äç
- Martial
   - Description: Martials move quick and hit hard. They're adept with physical weapons
   to directly damage enemies. Agile and light on their feet!
   - Primary Skill: Finesse
   - Suggested Suit: Diamonds ‚ô¶Ô∏è / Offense ü§õ
- Caster
   - Description: Casters can be mages of fantasy or techno-wizards of a much more
   mundane world. Their intellect drives them to skills the rest of us can barely
   comprehend.
   - Primary Skill: Knowledge
   - Suggested Suit: Spades ‚ô†Ô∏è / Conjuring ‚ö°Ô∏è

## Choose your Primary Suit

Roles come with primary suit suggestions, but this can be changed at each level-up.

- Diamonds ‚ô¶Ô∏è : Offense    ü§õ
- Clubs    ‚ô£Ô∏è : Defense    üõ°
- Hearts   ‚ô•Ô∏è : Life       ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äç
- Spades   ‚ô†Ô∏è : Conjuring  ‚ö°Ô∏è

Dealers are given special abilities based on their primary suit. First, `MISSING`
modifier. Second, `MISSING` Suit Mechanics that can be used as an action a number of
times equal to their level per long rest. Cards used in this manner are put directly in
the discard pile without inspection. The number of cards drawn in this manner `MISSING`.

- Diamonds ‚ô¶Ô∏è : Offense Dealers have explosive damage but they run out of gas really
fast. They can choose to *burn* up to 3 cards to `MISSING` attack draw.
- Clubs    ‚ô£Ô∏è : Defense Dealers have a strong foundation and can take the big hits. They
can choose to *bury* up to 3 cards to `MISSING` AC until the start of their next
turn.
- Hearts   ‚ô•Ô∏è : Life Dealers are fluid and flexible to adapt the situation. If they are
in the presence of an ally who fails a check, they may *toss* up to 3 cards and `MISSING`
- Spades   ‚ô†Ô∏è : Conjuring Dealers deploy all sorts of mechanisms for drawing the eye of
enemies away from their allies. They can *scrap* up to 3 cards and `MISSING` enemy draw.

## Using Experience Points

Both at character creation (4) and at the GM's discretion for each level up (3), you are
awarded Experience Points. These can be spent to gain additional Powers, boost an
Attribute, a Skill, add to the Powers you know, or remove a Vulnerability. Total XP is
equal to 1+ (level * 3).

### Choose Your Powers

Powers are your way of amplifying your character both on and off the battlefield. These
are additional perks and benefits to wielding certain types of weapons and magic and
have both mechanical and roleplay implications. Some Powers require a specific Role,
prerequisite levels or relevant Attribute/Skill Modifiers.

Simple, Minor and Major Powers cost 1, 1, and 2 XP respectively. A Simple Power may be
passive (always in effect) or can be used an unlimited number of times. A Minor or
Major Power is tiresome and requires Energy Points to use. Your character gains +1
Energy Points at a rate of +1 XP spent on Minor and Major Powers. A character with a
Major version of a Power may choose to use the Minor Power equivalent, but a character
with a Minor Power does not have access to the Major effect. On level-up, a player may
exchange 1 XP to convert a Minor Power to the Major equivalent.

Unless otherwise noted, Powers take one action to perform and add a Dealer's Primary
Skill Modifier. Unless otherwise noted, Powers with duration (e.g., an activated
shield) may only be used one at a time. Using a second Power will nullify the effects
of the first. Powers described as passive take no action and are always in effect.

### Choose Your Vulnerabilities

People are not perfect, and many have Vulnerabilities as a result of their relationship
with the world. At character creation you can choose up to three Vulnerabilities, which
add mechanical and roleplay implications, like being afraid of fire or unable to swim.
Adding Vulnerabilities to your character will grant you additional Experience Points
during character creation. Each Vulnerability added grants 1 or 2 Experience Points,
but you can only gain 4 total Experience Points during character creation. A GM may
overrule this limit if, for example, the events of the story result in a character
gaining an additional Vulnerability.

### Changing Attributes and Skills

All Attributes and Skills start at a +0 modifier. The Attribute modifier  `MISSING`.
You can adjust your Skills and Attributes using your Experience
Points, which will help define how capable your character for relevant actions. On
initial character creation, you can spend points to increase or gain points to decrease
Attributes and Skill Modifiers up to `MISSING`. This upper limit increases
on even level-ups `MISSING`. Once these are set at character creation, a
player may only add newly awarded Experience points.

Raising an Attribute Modifier by +1 initially costs 2 Experience Points. Raising a Skill
Modifier by +1 initially costs 1 Experience Point. In both cases, raising modifiers
becomes more costly as you add. The following table shows the cost in Experience Points
and the resulting modifier for Attributes and Skills.
