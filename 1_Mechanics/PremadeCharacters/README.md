# Premade Characters

These premade characters include all four Roles across the first four levels. 

1. **Defender** Thadius is a strength-based brute. He controls the battlefield and has
such a commanding presence that he can drag an enemy through sheer force of will. His
drive for violence could become an issue.

2. **Support** Jude is a kind, intuitive soul who would prefer to heal wounds rather 
than cause them. Her connection to an otherworldly diety brings magic to aid allies. 
Living among humans as an android has cultivated her drive for pacifism.

3. **Martial** Sparrow leads with his gut, in an instinctual connection to nature. Their
wolf companion is always by their side, an extension of their senses, and a 
manifestation of their commitment to protect the natural world at all costs.

4. **Caster** Locklear is learn'ed mage. He's light on his feet and uses magic to 
navigate the world, be it illusion or explosion. Vain to a fault, but some of his 
narcissism may be justified.
