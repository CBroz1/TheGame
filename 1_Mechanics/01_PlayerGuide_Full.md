## What is a Tabletop Game System?

A game system provides all of the rules, mechanics, and story-telling devices that are
used to describe how characters interact with the world during a session. During a game
session, a Game Master (GM) uses the rules laid out in a game system to set the stage
for a narrative that all players collectively move forward. Moment-to-moment, the GM
presents a scenario and players respond by attempting actions, either specified by the
game system or wholly invented. The GM determines a player’s success and failure, and
guides the group in a meaningful way. 

Choosing which Tabletop Roleplaying Game (TTRPG) to play is an important step when
starting an adventure and different game systems are better for different things.
Common game systems include Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition (5e) and Savage Worlds
Adventure Edition (SWADE); rules, supplements, and other materials for game systems can
be found in published volumes and elsewhere online. Deck of Adventures sets itself
apart by swapping out dedicated many-sided dice for a standard deck of playing cards.
While other TTRPGs rely on using dice to determine the results of an uncertain action,
Deck of Adventures just asks you to draw a card from your deck.

## Guiding Principles

In times of uncertainty, defer to the following:

1. Have fun. 
2. The Game Master (GM) is both the narrator and referee. They work to ensure the 
entire group has fun. They have the final say of rulings at the table and will work 
to try and resolve disputes between players that may come up.

## The Action Deck

Deck of Adventures is based around a 52-card deck: 13 cards (2-10, J, Q, K, and A)
across 4 suits, without Jokers. Each player should have their own Deck. 

1. Actions with unknown outcomes will require a player to make a check, which means drawing from their respective decks to help determine the outcome.
2. Kings and Aces are Fate Cards and should be reserved in one's hand, both player and 
GM. All other cards go directly into a discard pile. Hold on to these Fate Cards, even 
when shuffling the deck.
3. Players will use this deck to do most anything; it represents their character's 
stamina until they rest. When the Action Deck is empty and a player has to shuffle 
between rests, they draw with the Lower Hand (1+) until they would shuffle when resting.

## Fate Cards

Fate Cards (K and A) are a chance to control your fate. They permit the player to choose
when they want a second chance at a key moment.

1. Fate Cards drawn from the deck are played as usual, but remains in the player's hand.
2. Any time a player or the GM draws a card, they may discard a held Fate Card and 
redraw.
3. A GM may award a Fate Card (as pulled from the discard pile or signified by another
token) to a player for excellent play, including exemplifying their character’s
strengths or weaknesses.
    
## Characters

### Attributes, Skills, and Modifiers

1. Attributes are general domains that collectively make up a characters strengths and
weaknesses: Agility, Strength, Intuition, Intelligence, Conviction, and Vitality.
2. Skills are specific to an Attribute. Athletics is a Strength skill, but Bluffing is a
Conviction skill.
3. Modifiers reflect a character’s level of expertise given Attribute or Skill domain 
and add or subtract from the [Difficulty Class](./#making-a-check) of a given check.
4. Face cards retain their value relative to the 10 (J 11; Q 12; K 13; A 14).

Complete list:
- AGL Agility
   - Finesse (Fight)

### Dealers, Bystanders and Companions

1. Dealers. All player characters, and some in-game characters. They...
   1. Can have Powers and Vulnerabilities.
   2. Have `MISSING` health points (HP).
   3. Can receive and use Fate Cards.
2. Bystanders. All other characters. They...
   1. Are weaker than Dealers
   2. Have limited access to Powers
   3. Have `MISSING` health point.
3. Companions are creatures that can be associated with a Dealer, like a pet or other-worldly advisor. See the setting Bestiary for a list of potential Companions.

## During Play

### Out of Combat

The majority of time spent on adventures takes place outside of combat. This includes
exploring the world, investigating for clues, and engaging social interactions with
other players and non-playable characters found throughout the world. The GM will ask
players to Make a Check by drawing a card and adding the modifier relevant to the
circumstance.

1. **Setting the Scene.** The GM will include a brief descriptions of important events
and new locations to spark the narrative. Descriptions may hint at events ahead. Players
are encouraged to ask clarifying questions.
2. **What do I see?** Character often know more just by having direct access to the
world. Players may ask about the world, immediate environment or common knowledge a
character might have. The GM’s answer may depend on a successful check.
3. **Talking to the Locals.** The GM speaks on behalf of all other characters and will
respond with what the relevant character knows depending on the situation. Some checks
may determine the outcome of these conversations. When speaking either to the GM or
other players, players should remember to be respectful. A brash character is no excuse
to be rude to one’s fellow players.

### Making a Check

When the GM calls for a Check, they will reveal a reveal a Target Card (TC) and the
Attribute or Skill associated with the check. The GM may also reveal the Difficulty
Class (DC); this is the range around the target card the player might hope to draw and
may be widened or narrowed by the player's relevant modifier. The player will then draw
one or more cards and declare how far away from the TC they drew. The GM may describe
the nature of the outcome or announce the degree of success and ask the player to
describe the outcome. Exactly matching the TC in value, it's a Major Success. If the
drawn card is a perfect match (i.e., value and suit), it's a Critical Success. If the 
card drawn matches the suit, it is either a Suited Hit or a Suited Miss, depending on
whether or not it falls in the Success range. Suited Hit and Miss will only matter for 
characters with specific abilities. 

**For example**, when a Xena attempts to jump across a chasm, the GM reveals a TC of
the 8 of clubs and a DC of 2, asking for an Athletics check. If the player's Athletics 
modifier is +1, the check is ...
1. A Cricial Success if they draw the 8 of Clubs. They might perfectly make the
 jump, impressing their allies, and catch a glimps of something important in the 
 distance.
2. A Major Success if they draw any 8. They might make the jump gracefully enough to 
impress their allies without any other perks.
3. A Suited Hit if they draw any card within 3 (DC 2 + 1). For TC 8 / DC 3, this is 5, 
6, 7, 9, 10 or J. Xena might have a Power that grants benefits to allies on a Suited
Hit. 
3. A Success if they draw within XXX A Success would mean performing the jump as intended.
2. A Suited Miss if they draw any Club below 5 or above J. Xena might have a Power that 
lets them redraw on a Suited Miss, for example. 
3. A Miss is any other draw below 5 or above J.

Sometimes the odds will be in your favor; sometimes they will be against you. 
1. Having the Upper Hand (N) means you draw N additional cards and select the card 
closest to the TC after applying all relevant mechanics. 
2. Having the Lower Hand (N) means you draw N additional cards and select the card that 
is furthest from the TC after applying all relevant mechanics. 

In these cases, the other card is discarded. If N is not specified, draw 1 extra. If a 
rule specifies Upper/Lower Hand (N+), N cards are drawn, +1 for each instance the effect
is applied. For example, running through your Action Deck without resting is Lower
 Hand (1+). This means that, if it happens twice, draw 3. If another effect would also
 cause drawing with Lower Hand, draw 4.

When an Ace is revealed as the TC, the GM declares if it is an Ace Low or Ace High. If 
Ace Low, the DC may span 2, 3, 4, etc. If Ace High, the DC may span K, Q, J, etc. An Ace
drawn for a check is Wild, either High or Low, whichever is closer to the TC. For 
example, comparing the 2 and K rows below, an Ace can pass a DC of 1 in either case.

**Target Card Range Table**
For each card on the left, refer to the column with the corresponding sum of DC and 
Modifiers. Left of 0 is the lower bound, right of 0 is the upper bound.

|**Card**|**6**|**5**|**4**|**3**|**2**|**1**|**0**|**1**|**2**|**3**|**4**|**5**|**6**|

### In Combat

Some stories involve hostile forces that will threaten players with violence. The GM
decides when Combat begins and then a separate set of rules take effect. Combat in Deck
of Adventures is designed to be fast-paced, while leaving a lot of room for player
teamwork and creativity. To keep up the pace, players should be sure to study their
character sheets and know their options ahead of combat, and use others’ turns to make
their choices.

GMs may provide grided maps to help players visualize the situation. On a square grid,
moving diagonally counts as one space unless otherwise ruled by the GM.

#### Taking Turns

1. Combat order is determined by card draw. At the beginning of combat, all characters draw an 
Target Card and place it in on the table in view. The values represent the turn order (Ace 
first, then K, Q, etc.) and the TC for any attack. Players with the same initiative 
card values can decide who goes first. Without concensus, the player with the higher
Agility modifier goes first.
2. A player may delay their turn in initiative order intentionally to co-occur with
other players, but their turn is forfeited if they do not announce their action(s) by
the end of the round. A GM may skip a player’s turn if they are unprepared and need more
time to think.

#### In Combat Actions

On a turn, a character may (a) move, and (b) perform action(s) in any order they choose.
Each turn represents 6 seconds of game time passing.

1. **Movement** Character speed is equal to `MISSING`. The total may be split to occur 
before, after, and/or between actions.
2. **Actions** In addition to their movement, players can perform up to two actions each
turn. The first action is made without penalty. If players choose to make a second
action, `MISSING` penalty.
3. **Standard Attacks:** Character combat actions are described on the character sheet
are associated with the character's Primary Skill Modifier, unless otherwise noted. The
character draws a card and `MISSING` modifier.
4. **Saving Attacks:** Some attacks require the target(s) to make a check to resist the
effect, with the target(s) `MISSING`.
5. **Contested Checks**. Some actions will require both attacker and target to `MISSING`.
6. **Toughening Up** - A Dealer may choose to expend one Fate Card to nullify `MISSING` damage per round of combat. This is a free action and must be taken before the end of
the Dealer's next turn.

#### Effects

Some effects will impact a character over time.
1. **Stunned** If a Dealer takes `MISSING` damage in 1 hit, they `MISSING` Conviction 
Check at the start of their turn. If failed, they may
either move or make one action on their turn, not both. 
Some creatures can cause stunning effects as part of
their attacks.
2. **Entangled** At the start of their turn, a Dealer `MISSING`. 
If failed, they may not move on that turn.
`MISSING` prevents actions requiring arm movements.
3. **Knocked Down** Getting up prevents a Dealer from making more than 1 action on their
turn, and their movement speed is halved.
4. **Blinded, Deafened** At the start of their turn, a Dealer makes a `MISSING` spell-casting attribute of the creature causing the effect.
If Miss, they fraw Lower Hand (2) for any action requiring the relevant
sense.
6. **Outnumbered** Dealers may delay their turn to co-occur with another player Dealer.
For each additional Dealer attacking the same target within 1 space, attacks are made
with an additional +1 modifier.
7. **Knocked Out** Knocked out Dealers are unable to act until treated by a Craft check 
or a Healing Power (`MISSING` + number of turns since effect onset). Knocked Out Dealers remain unconscious for a length of time determined by the GM. If a Knocked Out Dealer is attacked further, the player begins
an Epic Event alone. Each additional hit requires a Check with a GM determined TC that the player may respond 
to with one or more cards to pass an unknown DC as the Great Void calls out to them.

### Health and Armor

Dealers have `MISSING` health points, Bystanders have `MISSING`, and the health of
Companions is determined by the level of their Dealer. If a character is wounded beyond
their health pool, they are Knocked Out. Armor points are an optional additional pool
that would be removed first in the event of a wound. Both health and armor points can
be recovered on a rest. Health is recovered with a Vitality check and Armor is
recovered with a Knowledge or Craft check.

AC is calculated by `MISSING`.

### Epic Events

At any point, the DM may call for an Epic Event, usually involves player(s) needing to
make a series of successes in a short time period. For example, an earthquake causes 
the building to become unsteady. All characters must act quickly to get out before 
a collapse

During an epic event...
1. Players draw 5 cards. 
2. The DM will call for a series of Checks, revealing TCs and correponding Attributes or
skills. Any subset of players may volunteer for any of these Checks.
3. During an individual check, players play 1 card and may sacrifice others. Each card 
sacrificed adds +1 modifier.
4. Fate Cards card mechanics remain the same: played Ks and As return to the  player’s
hand. If played as Fate Cards, they result in a number of discards and redraws equal to
the number Fate Cards played.
5. If no player volunteers for a check, or no player has cards remaining, the Check is
an automatic miss.

The GM determines when an Epic Event has been resolved, and how many individual checks
consititute collective success or failure. On successful resolution, the narrative will 
move forward and the GM will resume normal play. On a failure during an Epic Event, the 
GM will lay out the consequences and give the players a chance to react.

### Rests

A rest is an Epic Event in which players state what they hope to accomplish over the
rest. Each goal is a separate check the players must collectively pass. Taking a short
rest permits players to draw 3 cards, and long rest 5.

During a Rest, players might attempt to repair an item (including Armor), read a book,
recover Health Points (HP), or recover Energy Points. Recovering Health is a Vitality
Check with DC`MISSING`, -1 for each Health Point being recovered. Some Powers are limited-use
and require recharging associated Energy Points during a rest, at a Primary Skill Check 
DC `MISSING`, -1 for each Point being recovered. A Player who draws `MISSING`
recovers a smaller portion of Health or Energy Points equal `MISSING`.

Players take turns attempting their respective checks. Order is either determined by the
players themselves or the last played initiative order. The GM determines the DC for
each novel goal.

## Character Creation

Deck of Adventures offers both [premade characters](./PremadeCharacters/README.md) and a completely
customizable process. Consult with your GM for information about the setting and what
skills will be relevant for the story ahead. Custom creation starts with spending
Experience Points on Attributes, Skills, Powers, Vulnerabilities and/or Skills.

- Attributes cost more, but also increase corresponding skills.
- Spending points has diminishing returns. Going from 0 to +1 is relatively cheap, but
+3 to +4 will take many more points.
- Skill Modifiers start “unskilled,” with a `MISSING` Modifier, so choose carefully. 
- Vulnerabilities are roleplay and/or combat weaknesses and yield 1 or 2 additional
Experience Points to spend.
- Powers are special features, boons or strengths, that cost 1 or 2 points. Powers may have additional pre-requirements such as Role or Level. 

For a full set of character creation options, see our [Character Creation document](03_CharacterCreation.md).

## Starting your adventure

There are four steps to starting an adventure of Deck of Adventures:

1. **Find a group:** Deck of Adventures requires as few as two people, one Game Master (
GM) and one player, but richer stories can be told with more people bringing more to the
table. Join the Deck of Adventures Discord Server `LINK NEEDED` to find a group!
2. **Discuss play style:** Different players and GMs will have different preferences.
Some love light-hearted misadventures, others enjoy dark melodrama. Some stories involve
political intrigue, traditional dungeon crawling, reuniting lost lovers, or eldritch
horrors. Consult with your group to match preferences. A GM should always be able to
give hints, and take feedback on topics preferred or to be avoided.
3. **Choose your adventure:** You can choose to run one of Deck of Adventures’s standard
adventures (Modules) or in the Deck of Adventures Starter Kit. The mechanics described
here should be flexible to accommodate any story you want to tell, and GMs are invited
to make modifications to fit their setting.
4. **Pick a time and place:** Deck of Adventures is designed to be as fun played
in-person as it is online, so if you want to meet online we recommend using Roll20
because of the ability to draw virtual cards easily.

To prepare for your first time playing, keep in mind...

1. **Schedules:** Regular meetings help your group stay on track, and the action moving
forward.
2. **Getting on the same page:** A good ‘first’ session discussion topic is the story
ahead, including preferences and topics players wish to avoid. Next, players should
propose a character (idea or complete) to their GM. The GM may offer feedback to help
your character better fit the setting ahead, or offer inspiration on a more complete
backstory that fits the world. They will help you create your Character Sheet before the
first official session of play.
3. Players can prepare by knowing their character sheet, to be as quick as possible in
their decision making. Premade characters are designed around common Roles that the GM
can always help you understand. Custom characters are in your hands, and your's to
remember.
