## What is a Tabletop Game System?

A game system provides all of the rules, mechanics, and story-telling devices that are used to describe how characters interact with the world during a session. During a game session, a Game Master (GM) uses the rules laid out in a game system to set the stage for a narrative that all players collectively move forward. Moment-to-moment, the GM presents a scenario and players respond by attempting actions, either specified by the game system or wholly invented. The GM determines a player’s success and failure, and guides the group in a meaningful way. 

Choosing which Tabletop Roleplaying Game (TTRPG) to play is an important step when starting an adventure and different game systems are better for different things. Common game systems include Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition (5e) and Savage Worlds Adventure Edition (SWADE); rules, supplements, and other materials for game systems can be found in published volumes and elsewhere online. Deck of Adventures sets itself apart by swapping out dedicated many-sided dice for a standard deck of playing cards. While other TTRPGs rely on using dice to determine the results of an uncertain action, Deck of Adventures just asks you to draw a card from your deck.

## Guiding Principles

In times of uncertainty, defer to the following:

1. Have fun. 2. The Game Master (GM) is both the narrator and referee. They work to
ensure the entire group has fun. They have the final say of rulings at the table and
will work to try and resolve disputes between players that may come up.

## The Action Deck

Deck of Adventures is based around a 52-card deck: 13 cards (2-10, J, Q, K, and A)
across 4 suits, without Jokers.

1. To take any action, draw one card (or multiple at the GM's request) from your Action Deck. 
2. Kings and Aces are Fate Cards and should be reserved in your hand. All other cards go
directly into a discard pile.
3. When the Action Deck is empty, or if otherwise instructed by the GM, shuffle the
discard pile into the Action Deck and resume play, holding on to any unused Fate Cards
for future use!

Sometimes the odds will be in your favor; sometimes they will be against you. 
1. Having the Upper Hand means you draw 2 cards and pick the highest value, after
modifiers. The other cards is immediately discarded. This is your favor when you're
looking for a high total.
2. Having the Lower Hand means you draw 2 cards and pick the lower value, after
modifiers. The other card is immediately discarded. This could represent how difficult a
given task is for you.
3. Having a Wild Hand means you draw 2 cards and pick whichever card you prefer. 

## Fate Cards

Fate Cards (K and A) are a chance to control your fate. They permit the player to choose
when they want a second chance at a key moment.

1. Fate Cards drawn from the deck are critical successes, after which the card remains
in the player's hand.
2. Any time a player draws a card, they may discard a held Fate Card to a drawn card and
draw a new one.
3. A GM may award a Fate Card (as pulled from the discard pile or signified by another
token) to a player for excellent play, including exemplifying their character’s
strengths or weaknesses.
4. When exchanged as a Fate Card, Aces give the next card drawn a +5 modifier. 
    
## Characters

### Attributes, Skills, and Modifiers

1. Attributes are general domains that collectively make up a characters strengths and
weaknesses: Agility, Strength, Intuition, Intelligence, Conviction, and Vitality.
2. Skills are specific to an Attribute. Athletics is a Strength skill, but Bluffing is a
Conviction skill.
3. Modifiers reflect a character’s level of expertise given Attribute or Skill domain,
and are expressed as +/- modifiers ranging anywhere from -2, to +X. Modifiers are added
to the total of the card drawn when making any check relevant to that Attribute or
Skill.
4. When the GM asks a player to draw a card, they may announce the corresponding skill.
The player reports the card’s value with corresponding modifier. Totals above 10 can
either be reported as number value or face card value (J 11; Q 12; K 13; A 14).

### Dealers, Bystanders and Companions

1. Dealers. All player characters, and some in-game characters. They...
   1. Can have Powers and Vulnerabilities.
   2. Have 3 health points (HP).
   3. Can receive and use Fate Cards.
2. Bystanders. All other characters. They...
   1. Are weaker than Dealers
   2. Have limited access to Powers
   3. Have 1 health point.
3. Companions are creatures that can be associated with a Dealer, like a pet or other-worldly advisor. See the setting Bestiary for a list of potential Companions.

## During Play

### Out of Combat

The majority of time spent on adventures takes place outside of combat. This includes
exploring the world, investigating for clues, and engaging social interactions with
other players and non-playable characters found throughout the world. The GM will ask
players to Make a Check by drawing a card and adding the modifier relevant to the
circumstance.

1. **Setting the Scene.** The GM will include a brief descriptions of important events
and new locations to spark the narrative. Descriptions may hint at events ahead. Players
are encouraged to ask clarifying questions.
2. **What do I see?** Character often know more just by having direct access to the
world. Players may ask about the world, immediate environment or common knowledge a
character might have. The GM’s answer may depend on a successful check.
3. **Talking to the Locals.** The GM speaks on behalf of all other characters and will
respond with what the relevant character knows depending on the situation. Some checks
may determine the outcome of these conversations. When speaking either to the GM or
other players, players should remember to be respectful. A brash character is no excuse
to be rude to one’s fellow players.

### Making a Check

When the GM calls for a Check, they will specify the relevant Attribute or Skill. The
player then draws a card from their Action Deck and announces the total, plus the
relevant Modifier. Success is determined by comparing this total to the GM’s Difficulty
Class (DC), which the GM may or may not announce. The GM may describe the nature of the
outcome or announce the degree of success and ask the player to describe the outcome

1. Drawing a 2 is a complete failure, regardless of Modifier. There may be immediate or
future consequences. Unless otherwise specified, a player may not use a Fate Card to
avoid the critical failure
2. Drawing an Ace is a complete success regardless of DC. There may be immediate or \
future boons associated with this success, as determined by the GM.
3. A difference of 4 or more is a major success or failure. 
4. A difference of between 1 and 3 is a minor success.
5. When the total equals the DC, the check is a Match and the GM may decide that the
player succeeds, but with drawbacks.

**For example**, when jumping across a chasm at a DC 7 with no Athletics modifier:
1. Drawing a 3 is a major failure and might be associated with consequences, such as
falling from a great height.
2. Drawing a 6 is a minor failure and might result in just barely grabbing on to the far
ledge with minor injuries.
3. Drawing a 7 is a Match. The character might make it across, but drop an item in the
process.
4. Drawing a 9 is a minor success, performing as intended.
5. Drawing a Q is a major success. The character might catch a glimpse of something
important in the distance during their jump.

### In Combat

Some stories involve hostile forces that will threaten players with violence. The GM
decides when Combat begins and then a separate set of rules take effect. Combat in Deck
of Adventures is designed to be fast-paced, while leaving a lot of room for player
teamwork and creativity. To keep up the pace, players should be sure to study their
character sheets and know their options ahead of combat, and use others’ turns to make
their choices.

GMs may provide grided maps to help players visualize the situation. On a square grid,
moving diagonally counts as one space unless otherwise ruled by the GM.

#### Taking Turns

1. Combat order is determined by card draw. Every round, all characters draw a card to
determine order, Ace high first, down to Two. Matching cards follow standard card game
convention and are strongest in reverse alphabetical order of suits (Spades, Hearts,
Diamonds, Clubs).
2. A player may delay their turn in initiative order intentionally to co-occur with
other players, but their turn is forfeited if they do not announce their action(s) by
the end of the round. A GM may skip a player’s turn if they are unprepared and need more
time to think.

#### In Combat Actions

On a turn, a character may (a) move, and (b) perform action(s) in any order they choose.
Each turn represents 6 seconds of game time passing.

1. **Movement** Character speed is equal to 6 spaces ± Agility modifier. The total may
be split to occur before, after, and/or between actions.
2. **Actions** In addition to their movement, players can perform up to two actions each
turn. The first action is made without penalty. If players choose to make a second
action, the associated check is made at a -2 penalty.
3. **Standard Attacks:** Character combat actions are described on the character sheet
are associated with the character's Primary Skill Modifier, unless otherwise noted. The
character draws a card and applies this modifier, usually against a DC determined by the
GM depending on what the character is trying to hit. This special DC is called Armor
Class (AC).
4. **Saving Attacks:** Some attacks require the target(s) to make a check to resist the
effect, with the target(s) applying their relevant Skill Modifier as specified by the
power or action.
5. **Contested Checks**. Some actions will require both attacker and target to draw a
card and apply a relevant modifier. The highest total wins. For example, a character may
try to tackle an enemy to the ground. The two would make a contested check of Athletics
vs. Finesse.
6. **Toughening Up** - A Dealer may choose to expend one Fate Card to nullify one point
of damage per round of combat. This is a free action and must be taken before the end of
the Dealer's next turn.

#### Effects

Some effects will impact a character over time.
1. **Stunned** If a Dealer takes 2 or more damage in 1 hit, they make a DC 8 (+2 for
each additional damage) conviction check at the start of their turn. If failed, they may
either move or make one action on their turn, not both. A major failure on this check
leaves the Dealer unable to act.Some creatures can cause stunning effects as part of
their attacks.
2. **Entangled** At the start of their turn, a Dealer makes a Strength check against the
attribute of the creature causing the effect. If failed, they may not move on that turn.
A critical failure prevents actions requiring arm movements.
3. **Knocked Down** Getting up prevents a Dealer from making more than 1 action on their
turn, and their movement speed is halved.
4. **Blinded, Deafened** At the start of their turn, a Dealer makes a conviction check
against the spell-casting attribute of the creature causing the effect (or DC 5 if
physical effect). If failed, they take a -5 penalty to any action requiring the relevant
sense.
6. **Outnumbered** Dealers may delay their turn to co-occur with another player Dealer.
For each additional Dealer attacking the same target within 1 space, attack modifiers
are take an additional +2.
7. **Knocked Out** Knocked out Dealers are unable to act until treated by a Craft check (
DC 8 + number of turns since effect onset). If attacked further, the player begins an
Epic Event alone. Each additional hit is a Check they may respond to with one or more
cards to pass an unknown DC as the Great Void calls out to them.

### Health and Armor

Dealers have three health points, Bystanders have 1 health point, and the health of
Companions is determined by the level of their Dealer. If a character is wounded beyond
their health pool, they are Knocked Out. Armor points are an optional additional pool
that would be removed first in the event of a wound. Both health and armor points can
be recovered on a rest. Health is recovered with a Vitality check and Armor is
recovered with a Knowledge or Craft check.

AC is calculated by adding 8 to one of the following: Agility modifier, Vitality
modifier, or number of Armor points remaining. AC is the highest of these three
options.

### Epic Events

At any point, the DM may call for an Epic Event, usually involves player(s) needing to
make a series of successes in a short time period. During an epic event...

1. Players draw 5 cards. 
2. The DM will call for a series of checks. Any subset of players may volunteer for any
of these checks. The DC will be lowered relative to the number of players helping
complete a check.
3. During an individual check, players may play multiple cards as if playing the summed
value and the suit of the highest card (or chosen suit if multiple high cards). Summed
cards cannot result in a critical success.
4. Fate Cards card mechanics remain the same: played Ks and As return to the  player’s
hand. If played as Fate Cards, they result in a number of discards and redraws equal to
the number Fate Cards played.
5. If no player volunteers for a check, or no player has cards remaining, the check is a
critical failure.

The GM determines when an epic event has been resolved. On successful resolution, the
narrative will move forward and the GM will resume normal play. On a failure during an
Epic Event, the GM will lay out the consequences and give the players a chance to
react.

### Rests

A rest is an epic event in which players state what they hope to accomplish over the
rest. Each goal is a separate check the players must collectively pass. Taking a short
rest permits players to draw 3 cards, and long rest 5.

During a Rest, players might attempt to repair an item (including Armor), read a book,
recover Health Points (HP), or recover Energy Points. Recovering Health is a Vitality
check of DC 7 + 2 for each Health Point being recovered. Some Powers are limited-use
and require recharging associated Energy Points during a rest, at a Primary Skill DC of
7 + 1 for each Point being recovered. A Dealer who draws below the DC indicated above
recovers a smaller portion of Health or Energy Points equal to the number drawn minus
7.

Players take turns attempting their respective checks. Order is either determined by the
players themselves or the last played initiative order. The GM determines the DC for
each novel goal.

## Character Creation

Deck of Adventures offers both premade characters `LINK NEEDED` and a completely
customizable process. Consult with your GM for information about the setting and what
skills will be relevant for the story ahead. Custom creation starts with spending
Experience Points on Attributes, Skills, Powers, Vulnerabilities and/or Skills.

- Attributes cost more, but also increase corresponding skills.
- Spending points has diminishing returns. Going from 0 to +1 is relatively cheap, but
+3 to +4 will take many more points.
- Skill Modifiers start “unskilled,” with a -2 Modifier, so choose carefully. 
- Vulnerabilities are roleplay and/or combat weaknesses and yield 1 or 2 additional
Experience Points to spend.
- Powers are special features, boons or strengths, that cost 1 or 2 points.

## Starting your adventure

There are four steps to starting an adventure of Deck of Adventures:

1. **Find a group:** Deck of Adventures requires as few as two people, one Game Master (
GM) and one player, but richer stories can be told with more people bringing more to the
table. Join the Deck of Adventures Discord Server `LINK NEEDED` to find a group!
2. **Discuss play style:** Different players and GMs will have different preferences.
Some love light-hearted misadventures, others enjoy dark melodrama. Some stories involve
political intrigue, traditional dungeon crawling, reuniting lost lovers, or eldritch
horrors. Consult with your group to match preferences. A GM should always be able to
give hints, and take feedback on topics preferred or to be avoided.
3. **Choose your adventure:** You can choose to run one of Deck of Adventures’s standard
adventures (Modules) or in the Deck of Adventures Starter Kit. The mechanics described
here should be flexible to accommodate any story you want to tell, and GMs are invited
to make modifications to fit their setting.
4. **Pick a time and place:** Deck of Adventures is designed to be as fun played
in-person as it is online, so if you want to meet online we recommend using Roll20
because of the ability to draw virtual cards easily.

To prepare for your first time playing, keep in mind...

1. **Schedules:** Regular meetings help your group stay on track, and the action moving
forward.
2. **Getting on the same page:** A good ‘first’ session discussion topic is the story
ahead, including preferences and topics players wish to avoid. Next, players should
propose a character (idea or complete) to their GM. The GM may offer feedback to help
your character better fit the setting ahead, or offer inspiration on a more complete
backstory that fits the world. They will help you create your Character Sheet before the
first official session of play.
3. Players can prepare by knowing their character sheet, to be as quick as possible in
their decision making. Premade characters are designed around common Roles that the GM
can always help you understand. Custom characters are in your hands, and your's to
remember.
