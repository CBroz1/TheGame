## Roles

- Admins (a) mange permissions and versioning decisions, (b) merge pull requests.
- Moderators integrate proposed changes by drafting pull requests from issues, and may make minor direct edits.
- Community leaders triage major and minor edits via GitHub issue labeling and pull request comments.
- Contributors have drafted major changes.

**Major edits** include substantial additions to this repository or revisions of multiple existing sections. An edit is considered major if it has the potential to introduce conflicts with existing material. **Minor edits** include short clarification phrases or corrections to existing work. In the event of confusion, admin will make the final decision regarding the scope of the change, and reserve the right to revert changes.

Admin are the core personnel for Deck of Adventure with administrative privileges in GitHub. Admin are in charge of making versioning decisions and merging outstanding pull requests from both admin and moderators. Admin should not self-merge after version 0.0.0a1. Moderators are appointed by admin and invited to draft pull requests of either original work or collections of materials from Contributors. Moderators are provided direct commit privileges for the purposes of minor edits only. Moderator status may be revoked in the event of reoccurring disagreements regarding the nature of major vs. minor edits.

Community leaders support these endeavors by organizing and prioritizing both GitHub issues and pull requests. Members of the community may be identified as Contributors by substantial contributions to GitHub issues or personal communication with other Deck of Adventure team members.
