## Companion Options 
*I'm using Suits/Elements as a way for us to generate companion options to start. Players can take a Companion of any Element to start, but must take one of a corresponding Element (Suit) proficiency bonus at higher levels to activate Elemental Companion effects - for level 1 these just represent common beasts but at higher levels they can become Elementals and gain additional effects*

### Companion Options - Level 1 

**Air - Scout** 
- Falcon/Hawk 
- As an action, you can draw two cards for a Detection check and use the higher number when your companion is present.
- As an action, you can have your companion swoop into an enemy and distract it, giving allies a +2 to hit on attacks made against that enemy.

**Earth - Tank**
- Bear
- Your Companion can take two wounds (more at higher levels) with an AC equal to 8+Elemental Proficiency Bonus. 
- This companion is able to grapple enemies as an action, rooting them in place and granting allies who hit the enemy an additional +2 on the attack draw. 

**Fire - Damage**
- Wolf/Tiger
- Your Companion can engage enemies in melee and use their attacks to deal damage. As an action, you can send your Companion to attack an enemy, and draw two cards and take the higher number whenever that enemy is also engaged in melee (within 1 square) of an ally who is not unconscious. 

**Water - Support** 
- Horse/Deer
- This Companion can be ridden or used to grant additional movement on your turn. When ridden, the Companion can use a free action each turn to add 3 squares of movement to whoever is riding on the Companion. 
- Additionally, when engaging in close combat this Companion can use its hooves to make it harder for an enemy to hit, imposing a double draw take the lower card on a single enemy's to-hit draw when within 1 square.
