# Introduction to the World of Pelagia

Pelagia is a collaborative roleplaying setting where people who wield magic from the Gods have the power to shape the future of the world of Pelagia. You play as one of those people, and you are joined by others on your adventures through Pelagia. 

Pelagia employs the Deck of Adventures system, which can be enjoyed with friends both in-person and virtually and is being created by passionate gamers who are working to build a community of players who enjoy narrative roleplaying games. We hope you enjoy playing Pelagia!
