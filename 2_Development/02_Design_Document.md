# Design Document

## Drafting specifics

- The following are not permitted in filenames: `` () {} [] !@#$%^&* ' ` `` and spaces.
- Flavor text that is included in under mechanics always be separable for future
  versions that will apply to different settings. To identify flavor text, use quotes
  within the parent formatting scheme. For example:
   - The Defender Archetype is ...
   - > Defender of Pelagia are renowned for their mighty shields ...
- Specialized terms are listed in the [Glossary](../1_Mechanics/99_Glossary.md) and will
  be capitalized across all documents.
- Terms that are for flavor, not mechanics, are *Italicized*

## Core Design Principles

Deck of Adventures is, first and foremost, designed for **accessibility**, both in ease
of on-boarding and ease of access. Not everyone has specialty dice or the time to study
complex interconnected rules released over a long history. While becoming a Game
Master (GM) may take some time and dedication, a player completely new to tabletop
roleplaying should be able to pick up Deck of Adventures and start playing within an
hour. This means mechanics should be easy to learn, and easy to explain during a first
session. One only needs a standard deck of playing cards.

Second, Deck of Adventures is designed to be **flexible**, across the many types of
stories GMs want to tell. While our mechanics have been work shopped with lore from the
World of Pelagia, all core mechanics should be portable to another setting. The flavor
text that surrounds mechanics will change beyond Pelagia, but the features themselves
should stay the same.

Third, participants should be able to quickly and easily engage in **rich storytelling**
with only a standard deck of playing cards. Any component that doesn't contribute to
this end should be revisited. Accessible and flexible doesn't, however, mean sparse. A
first-time player can pick up a pre-made character in minutes, but then optionally
spend much longer planning out how to make a bespoke character that speaks to them,
with creativity fueled by the wide array of choices.
