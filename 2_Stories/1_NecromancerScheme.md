# The Necromancer's Scheme

<!-- Work in progress - mapping out the structure of the One Shot to start --> 

## Backstory:

1. The village of Garvandis is under attack by a being known as the Necromancer
2. Over the past year, a series of disappearances in the village
3. There are strange lights and noises coming from the East, near an old graveyard
4. The previous night, Arvund, the Village Elder went missing
5. His home was robbed, and the Staff of Garvandis is gone too
6. Players are hired by the Adventurer's Guild to investigate the disappearances

## Running the One Shot: 

### GM Note: Assets Needed

1. Battle map for the Graveyard
2. Tokens for Players, Arvund, Necromancer, Skeletons, Zombies, Skeletal Horses, and Villagers
3. Spooky ambient music and combat music

### Part 1: Exploring the Village

1. Players begin in the village square filled with small homes, a Tavern, and a Shop
2. Players can talk to the villagers, asking questions and looking for more information
3. When the initial investigation is wrapping up, or between conversations with villagers, the Players hear screams from outside.
4. Trigger Epic Event, as Zombies are trying to drag villagers away on the road heading East.
	- N TCs, where N = Player Count + 1
	- Success on a TC, the Zombie crumbles and villagers is saved
	- Failure on a TC, the Zombie drags the villagers away
5. In a nearby clearing, the Zombies are taking villagers to a carriage being pulled by two skeletal horses.
	- Some villagers are already in the carriage, having been taken from elsewhere in the village
	- If Epic Event is failed, determine one Player who failed the TC and have them taken away too
6. The villagers are bound and gagged, tied to each other in the back of the carriage.
7. The Players watch the Carriage taking off down the road to the East, and Players follow.

### Part 2: The Graveyard 

1. Players venture until they see the edge of the Graveyard, where there are patrols of undead guarding the Gates. 
2. Players can choose to defeat the guards or sneak past them into the Graveyard.
3. They see the carriage tied up near a mausoleum entrance, which appears to be the largest stone building in the Graveyard.
4. Patrolling undead nearby and the two skeletal horses are still tied to the carriage. If Players are spotted, initiate Combat.
	- Undead are weak minions but can be resurrected by an Acolyte
	- When Combat starts an Acolyte runs out of the mausoleum to defend the entrance
	- Acolyte is a Dealer, an apprentice of the Necromancer 
5.

6. After defeating the Skeleton Necromancer, investigate mausoleum, discovering a tunnel within the building that leads deeper into a summoning chamber. There is a trap, DR 2 Detection or Investigation, that if triggered deals 2 poison damage to the character who triggered it.

7. See the Necromancer performing a ritual on the villagers taken from the carriage, including the village elder. Necromancer is holding a strange, glowing artifact, and the villagers are caught in a glowing bubble that prevents them from moving or escaping. 

### The Necromancer Boss Battle 

The Necromancer has been corrupted to his very heart by the prospect of permanent undeath. Immortality at any cost, and the lives he's sacrificed in this chamber are untold. He is within reach of dozens of corpses, and feels very confident in his power here, even when some of his minions die. "We will all be Reborn!" He cannot be talked out of continuing to sacrifice villagers. 

**The Necromancer Stat Block**

**Passive Powers**
1. Necromantic Bond: Can channel magical energy to assume full control of a Corpse, turning it into an Aspect. During this time, the Aspect retains the mental statistics of the Necromancer, and can use Powers.
2. Undying: The Necromancer cannot be killed by traditional weapons. Upon reaching 0 HP, the Necromancer's body goes into a stasis. On the following dawn, they return to 1 HP.
3. Bloodthirsty: When the Necromancer gains HP while at max HP, the extra healing becomes AP, capped at 3 AP.

**Vulnerabilities**
1. Sunless: When sunlight touches the Necromancer, they take 1 damage at the start of their turn. If this damage would trigger the Undying Passive, the Necromancer instead dies. 
2. Undead Appearance: The Necromancer's skin is visibly changed as a result of their undeath. Those who observe him can make a DR 2 Intelligence Check to detect that he is Undead. 

**Major Actions**
1. Baleful Glare: Force one target within 10 spaces to make a DR 2 Conviction Check. On a failure, the target takes 2 damage and is Stunned. On a success, target takes half damage and is not Stunned. 
2. Drain Life: Forces all targets within 2 spaces to make a DR 2 Vitality Check. On a failure, take one damage. The Necromancer is healed for the total amount of damage dealt.
3. Raise Skeleton: Discard 7 cards. These cards form a number of Minion piles and a Skeleton is summoned under the Necromancer's control for each pile. These Minions acts immediately after the Necromancer's turn, and can only move and use one Major Action on their turn. Every time the Skeleton takes damage, exile 1 card. When the Minion Pile is empty, the Skeleton dies. When the Skeleton is summoned, the Necromancer decides if they are melee or ranged.

**Minor Actions** 
1. Corpse Walk: The Necromancer can swap places with a Minion within 12 spaces. The Minion can make one attack after the swap is complete.
2. Amplify Curse: Discard a card for any creature currently Stunned or Entangled. They take 1 damage. 
3. Frost Presence: Discard 5 cards. Target a creature within 10 spaces. The creature makes a DR 2 Conviction Check. On a failure, the next check that creature makes will be with the Lower Hand. 

**Adversary Actions**
1. Drain Stamina: All creatures within 2 spaces must make a DR 2 GUT Check. On a failure, discard the top two cards. On a success only discard the top card. Any cards drained are added to the Necromancer's discard pile instead of the Player's discard pile.  
2. Frost Zone: Summon a portal to the netherworld in a 4 space cube. When a creature enters the space, and for every space of movement through it, they make a DR 4 Conviction Check. On a failure, the creature makes their next Check at Lower Hand.   
3. Raise Reinforcements: Target up to 3 Skeletons that have fallen. Discard up to 6 cards and create Minion Piles for those Minions.  

**House Actions** 
1. Bone Wall: All creatures within 2 spaces of a wall must make a DR 2 Agility Check. On a failure, take 1 point of damage and are Entangled. If no creatures are within this space, or all Players succeed, summon 2 Skeletons. 
2. Skeletal Reinforcements: Skeletons appear throughout the space. The GM can draw a card to determine how many Skeletons appear.  
3. Sigil Summon: Summon 1 Necromancer Aspect in the center of the room. This is a version of the Necromancer that can use Powers but only has 3 HP. 

#### Multi-Phase Battle: 3 Phases

**Phase 1:**

Villagers and Arvund are caught in a bubble of magical energy, they can't be physically interacted with. There is an altar that can be disrupted with a DR 2 Check that releases the bubble, or it is automatically dispersed at the end of Phase 1. 

Necromancer summons Skeletons around the chamber, with two of them being Elite Minions (more HP and +1 higher Skills).

There are no house actions during this Phase. 

**Phase 2:** 

The bubble is disrupted and the villagers are free to escape. The Necromancer will attempt to attack or restrain the villagers using Frost Zone as an Adversary Action for the first time. Players see the villagers freeze up in the zone and collapse to the ground on a failed check (drained, not killed). 

House Actions begin in this phase, starting with 1. Bone Wall. This will Entangle any nearby villagers as well.   

**Phase 3:**

The Necromancer says "You will all suffer!" The ground opens up underneath each Player, forcing a DR 2 AGI check. On a failure, a grave opens up beneath their feet and swallows them up, Entangling them. To escape, they must use a Major Action to make a Strength Check, DR 3, or they remain in the grave. The Necromancer can use Drain Life to affect any creature currently in a grave even outside of the ordinary 2 space range.
