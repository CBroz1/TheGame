# The Necromancer's Scheme

<!-- Work in progress - mapping out the structure of the One Shot to start --> 

## Backstory:

1. The village of Garvandis is under attack by a being known as the Necromancer
2. Over the past year, a series of disappearances in the village
3. There are strange lights and noises coming from the East, near an old graveyard
4. The previous night, Arvund, the Village Elder went missing
5. His home was robbed, and the Staff of Garvandis is gone too
6. Players are hired by the Adventurer's Guild to investigate the disappearances

## Running the One Shot: 

### GM Note: Assets Needed

1. Battle map for the Graveyard
2. Tokens for Players, Arvund, Necromancer, Skeletons, Zombies, Skeletal Horses, and Villagers
3. Spooky ambient music and combat music

### Part 1: Exploring the Village

1. Players begin in the village square filled with small homes, a Tavern, and a Shop
2. Players can talk to the villagers, asking questions and looking for more information
3. When the initial investigation is wrapping up, or between conversations with villagers, the Players hear screams from outside.
4. Trigger Epic Event, as Zombies are trying to drag villagers away on the road heading East.

*You see in the distance a group of villagers who are being dragged to the East by a horde of Zombies. This is not a combat situation, they are getting away! We start an Epic Event by drawing TCs for each check, and Players decide what Skill they will use to get a DR 3 Suited Success on each TC. Remember, multiple Players can attempt a Check, but you can't attempt two Checks in a row.*

	- N TCs, where N = Player Count + 1
	- Success on a TC, the Zombie crumbles and villagers is saved
	- Failure on a TC, the Zombie successfully drags the villager away
5. In a nearby clearing, the Zombies are moving villagers into a carriage being pulled by two skeletal horses.
	- Some villagers are already in the carriage, having been taken from elsewhere in the village
	- Players observing will get the sense that these Zombies are not mindless, they are being driven and controlled in a very thoughtful and specific way. Once the villagers are loaded in, the skeletal horses take off down the road to the East, leaving the Zombies behind to meander around, as if no longer under that same thoughtful control.
6. The villagers are bound and gagged, tied to each other in the back of the carriage.
7. The Players watch the Carriage taking off down the road to the East, and Players can choose to follow quietly or hurry down the road.
	- If Players go quietly, by the time they reach the Graveyard they see an empty Carriage in front of the Mauseleum. If they choose to hurry and stay on the main road, they will see the villagers being dragged into the Mauseleum by Skeleton Minions. 

### Part 2: The Graveyard 

1. Players venture until they see the edge of the Graveyard, where there are patrols of undead guarding the entrance to the Mauseleum. 
2. Players can choose to defeat the guards or sneak past them into the Mauseleum.
3. They see the carriage tied up near a mausoleum entrance, which appears to be the largest stone building in the Graveyard.
4. Patrolling Skeleton Minions and Zombies nearby and the two skeletal horses are still tied to the carriage. If Players are spotted, initiate Combat.
	- Undead are weak minions but they are varied in strength. The two closest to the door are both 1HP 1AP but two patrolling to the East are only 1 HP each. 
	- If the skeletal horses are attacked or enraged, they will take a single attack on the nearest living creature (ignoring Undead) and then use their remaining movement (8 spaces) to move away from the attacker. 
5. To the Northeast and Northwest are patches of graves that Players can investigate. 
	- In both areas are graves, they can see disturbed graves and discarded bones, as if someone picked over corpses and left the more rotted and broken pieces behind.
	- Northwest has a group of Undead that are triggered by approaching any of the top two graves (within 2 spaces). 
	- Northeast is a graveyard that the Players can find a Minor Magical Item with a DR 2 Investigation Check. This is part of the Necromancer's items, and the Players should be told that there's likely a Necromancer nearby. 

5. Entering the Mauseleum, the first Player in the door hears a voice in their head, asking why they've come. This is the voice of the Necromancer, and an animated Skeleton stands up from a throne in the center of the room. The Skeleton moves its mouth but the words are coming from the Necromancer in the Players heads. The Necromancer is overconfident and assumes the Players are here to rescue the Villagers. The Players may ask questions of the Necromancer but after a time the Necromancer becomes Hostile. The Skeleton becomes an Aspect of the Necromancer and Combat is initiated.

6. Aspect of the Necromancer uses all the same stats as the Necromancer, and can be treated as the first phase of the Necromancer Boss Fight, including the use of some House and Adversary actions.  

6. After defeating the Aspect of the Necromancer, investigate mausoleum, discovering a tunnel within the building that leads deeper into a summoning chamber. There is a chamber with piles of bones, in much better condition than the ones that were visible in the graves on the surface. There is a trap in the hallway leading out of this Chamber, DR 2 Detection or Investigation, that if triggered deals 2 damage to the character who triggered it. After a successful Detection or Investigation, or after the first creature triggers it, Players can move at half speed through the space without taking damage. If they choose to move at full speed, they take 1 damage.

7. Before the Main Chamber after the trap is a nook in the northeast with rotted barrels and low burning candles. If the Players Investigate this area (DR 2), they learn that the Barrels are leaking Acid, which causes 1 damage when applied to a Target. You can fill a glass vial with this substance and throw it using Finesse or Brute. 

8. Entering the chamber, the Players see the Necromancer standing in a ritual circle while the villagers are nearby, visibly stuck in a sickly green bubble. Among the villagers is Arvund, who is standing with them trying to calm them down. The Necromancer is holding a strange, glowing artifact, and the villagers are unable to move out of the glowing bubble that prevents them from moving or escaping. The bubble is immune to damage, and can only be lowered by ending the Enchantment from the Necromancer. 

### The Necromancer Boss Battle 

The Necromancer has been corrupted to his very heart by the prospect of permanent undeath. Immortality at any cost, and the lives he's sacrificed in this chamber are untold. He is within reach of dozens of corpses, and feels very confident in his power here, even when some of his minions die. "We will all be Reborn!" 

He cannot be talked out of continuing to sacrifice villagers, "My immortality awaits!". 

**The Necromancer Stat Block**

**Passive Powers**
1. Necromantic Bond: Can channel magical energy to assume full control of a Corpse, turning it into an Aspect. During this time, the Aspect retains the mental statistics of the Necromancer, and can use Powers.
2. Undying: The Necromancer cannot be killed by traditional weapons. Upon reaching 0 HP, the Necromancer's body goes into a stasis. On the following dawn, they return to 1 HP.
3. Bloodthirsty: When the Necromancer gains HP while at max HP, the extra healing becomes AP, capped at 3 AP.

**Vulnerabilities**
1. Sunless: When sunlight touches the Necromancer, they take 1 damage at the start of their turn. If this damage would trigger the Undying Passive, the Necromancer instead dies. 
2. Undead Appearance: The Necromancer's skin is visibly changed as a result of their undeath. Those who observe him can make a DR 2 Intelligence Check to detect that he is Undead. 

**Major Actions**
1. Baleful Glare: Force one target within 10 spaces to make a DR 2 Conviction Check. On a failure, the target takes 2 damage and is Stunned. On a success, target takes half damage and is not Stunned. 
2. Drain Life: Forces all targets within 2 spaces to make a DR 2 Vitality Check. On a failure, take one damage. The Necromancer is healed for the total amount of damage dealt.
3. Raise Skeleton: Discard 7 cards. These cards form a number of Minion piles and a Skeleton is summoned under the Necromancer's control for each pile. These Minions acts immediately after the Necromancer's turn, and can only move and use one Major Action on their turn. Every time the Skeleton takes damage, exile 1 card. When the Minion Pile is empty, the Skeleton dies. When the Skeleton is summoned, the Necromancer decides if they are melee or ranged.

**Minor Actions** 
1. Corpse Walk: The Necromancer can swap places with a Minion within 12 spaces. The Minion can make one attack after the swap is complete.
2. Amplify Curse: Discard a card for any creature currently Stunned or Entangled. They take 1 damage. 
3. Frost Presence: Discard 5 cards. Target a creature within 10 spaces. The creature makes a DR 2 Conviction Check. On a failure, the next check that creature makes will be with the Lower Hand. 

**Adversary Actions**
1. Drain Stamina: All creatures within 2 spaces must make a DR 2 GUT Check. On a failure, discard the top two cards. On a success only discard the top card. Any cards drained are added to the Necromancer's discard pile instead of the Player's discard pile.  
2. Frost Zone: Summon a portal to the netherworld in a 4 space cube. When a creature enters the space, and for every space of movement through it, they make a DR 4 Conviction Check. On a failure, the creature makes their next Check at Lower Hand.   
3. Raise Reinforcements: Target up to 3 Skeletons that have fallen. Discard up to 6 cards and create Minion Piles for those Minions.  

**House Actions** 
1. Bone Wall: All creatures within 2 spaces of a wall must make a DR 2 Agility Check. On a failure, take 1 point of damage and are Entangled. If no creatures are within this space, or all Players succeed, summon 2 Skeletons. 
2. Skeletal Reinforcements: Skeletons appear throughout the space. The GM can draw a card to determine how many Skeletons appear.  
3. Sigil Summon: Summon 1 Necromancer Aspect in the center of the room. This is a version of the Necromancer that can use Powers but only has 3 HP. 

#### Multi-Phase Battle: 3 Phases

**Phase 1:**

Villagers and Arvund are caught in a bubble of magical energy, they can't be physically interacted with. If the artifact in the Necromancer's hands is targeted directly, the Enchantment can be disrupted with a DR 2 Check that will release the bubble. The bubble is automatically dispersed at the end of Phase 1. 

Necromancer summons Skeleton Minions around the chamber, and two Necromancer Aspects (each with half the health of the original).

There are no House actions during this first Phase, and the Necromancer will continue to channel energy into the Ritual as his Major Action unless provoked or directly attacked. 

**Phase 2:** 

The bubble is disrupted and the villagers are free to escape. The Necromancer will attempt to attack or restrain the villagers using Frost Zone as an Adversary Action for the first time. Players see the villagers freeze up in the zone and collapse to the ground on a failed check (drained, not killed). 

House Actions begin in this phase, starting with 1. Bone Wall. This will Entangle any nearby villagers as well.   

*Note - the villagers are not aware of the spike trap as it was disarmed when they were brought here. If they move at full speed they will be killed unless led out of the lair.*

**Phase 3:**

The Necromancer says "You will all suffer!" The ground opens up underneath each Player, forcing a DR 2 AGI check. On a failure, a grave opens up beneath their feet and swallows them up, Entangling them. To escape, they must use a Major Action to make a Strength Check, DR 3, or they remain in the grave. The Necromancer can use Drain Life to affect any creature currently in a grave even outside of the ordinary 2 space range.

The Necromancer continues to summon Skeletons, and attempts to kill nearby Villagers - if he successfully kills a Villager he will use his next available Action (Adversary, Major, or House) to resurrect the Villager as a Skeleton Minion.

*GM Lock Note for running the Necromancer Boss Fight - always make sure you're keeping track of new Minions as they come into the fight, adding them correctly in the turn order and keeping the Minion piles straight when drawing. An organized GM side of the table is very necessary for a fight with this many moving pieces! Also - use Corpse Walk often, especially for the Aspects! This comboes nicely with Drain Life.*

### Defeating the Necromancer

When the Players finish the 3rd Phase, the Necromancer's bones collapse to the ground. They continue to glow dully, as if a spirit still inhabits the bones. In order to kill the Necromancer completely, their bones must be exposed to direct sunlight for 1 minute. When complete, the Necromancer is killed. If this does not happen, at the following day's sunset the Necromancer returns to life with 1 HP.

### Rewards

Players can loot the Necromancer and the Ritual Chamber after the combat. They receive 1) Gem of Garvandis, 500 gp worth of smaller gems that appear to no longer be magical, and if Arvund is still alive he will reward them with 2000 more gp when they return safely to town. (If he was killed but other villagers are alive, Players still get 1000 additional gp).

**The Gem of Garvandis**
- This upgrade material can be applied to a) a weapon or b) a piece of armor.
- When applied to a weapon, grants +1 fire damage to every successful Attack. 
- When applied to a piece of armor, grants +1 Max HP and +1 Max FP while wearing that armor. 
- A DR 1 Craft Check with Jeweler's Tools must be made to apply the gem permanently, but a failure on that Check means it will fall off after 1 hour. Once it has fallen off, the Check can only be re-attempted the following day until successful.
- A Merchant or Tradesman might be able to apply the gem for you, but it will cost you for their services. These can be found in most major cities and sporadically around the world.
- If sold, the Gem is worth 1000gp

The following morning's sunset is brilliant and shining, and the town's spirits seem to be lifted. People are cheery and smile at you all as you walk through the town. "Thank you heroes!", and "Adventurers like you are always welcome here!" echo through the streets as you make your way out of the Tavern. Players can take their new gp and spend it at the General Store, or inquire as to someone who can infuse the Gem of Garvandis into a weapon or Armor for them.
