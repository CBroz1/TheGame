# Starting Gear and Weapons

The starting weapons and items commonly found in Pelagian adventures. Look for an item that appeals to you as a starting weapon based on your Archetype. Consult with your GM if you have any questions about these items or which ones you can start with.  

- Crystal Armor:
    - Archetypes: Hunter, Knight, Defender
    - Power Rating: ♦️
    - Description: You can channel a spell from a set of Crystal Armor.
- Crystal Hilt: Standard
    - Archetypes: Knight, Defender, Hunter
    - Power Rating: ♦️♦️♦️
    - Item Type: Magic Item, Melee Weapon, Ranged Weapon, Shield, Weapon
    - Rarity: Rare
    - One Handed
    - Description: The raw resource of Magecite is often refined into a crystaline form and imbued into special hilts that can handle such a power source. When activated, their energy either coalesces into a melee weapon (e.g., sword, shield) or raw energy that can be launched as a ranged attack, depending on the preference of the user. Hilts shape their weapon as elemental effects, with hilts creating different elemental weapons depending on the wielder. These weapons appear as some combination of ice, stone, fire or lightning when activated.
- Crystal Hilt: Heavy
    - Archetypes: Knight, Defender, Hunter
    - Power Rating: ♦️♦️♦️
    - Item Type: Magic Item, Melee Weapon, Ranged Weapon, Shield, Weapon
    - Rarity: Rare
    - Two Handed

- Crystal Focus
    - Archetypes: Blessed
    - Power Rating: ♦️♦️♦️♦️
    - Two Handed
    - Rarity: Rare
    - Description: Focuses come in various shapes and sizes, but most either have a massive Magecite gemstone in the center of them or are covered in various powerful Magecite gems. These Focuses are extremely powerful when wielded correctly, and a wielder can channel far more spells through a Crystal Focus than a standard Hilt.
- Crystal Wand
    - Archetypes: Blessed
    - Power Rating: ♦️♦️
    - Rarity: Rare
    - One Handed
    - Description: Some Blessed prefer to use a Crystal Wand over a focus to allow for a shield or other weapon in their offhand. A Crystal Wand often has a single gemstone gleaming at the end of it, which a wielder can use to unleash devastating spells on their foes or heal and support their allies.
