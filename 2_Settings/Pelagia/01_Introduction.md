# World of Pelagia

## Introduction

Pelagia is a collaborative roleplaying setting where people who wield magic from the
Gods have the power to shape the future of the world of Pelagia. You play as one of
those people, and you are joined by others on your adventures through Pelagia.

Pelagia employs the Deck of Adventures system, which can be enjoyed with friends both
in-person and virtually and is being created by passionate gamers who are working to
build a community of players who enjoy narrative roleplaying games. We hope you enjoy
playing Pelagia!

## Elements and Roles

The ubiquity of magic in Pelagia often maps onto four elements, which are also
associated with the four suits. A character's 'Caster' role might instead be described
as a Fire Mage or Lightning Wizard.

- Diamonds‚ô¶Ô∏è : Offense    ü§õ   (e.g,. Air Ranger)
- Clubs   ‚ô£Ô∏è : Defense    üõ° 	   (e.g., Earth Tank)
- Hearts  ‚ô•Ô∏è : Life       ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π (e.g., Water Healer)
- Spades  ‚ô†Ô∏è : Conjuring  ‚ö°Ô∏è   (e.g., Fire Mage)

## People of Pelagia

As the nation of Pelagia expanded it started to interact with and expand to other
islands and cultures. Just like any other nation it is made up of different peoples
from different climates, backgrounds, origins, etc. Each of the people have descended
from different creatures or animals over time and are all living together in one
nation.

## Magic

Magic comes from many different sources in Pelagia, but nowhere is it more prevalent and
found in the world than in the forms of Crystals.

**What is Magecite?** Magecite crystals are excavated from Mines throughout the Pelagian
  seas, and they are extremely valuable and powerful crystals. Their power depends on
  the size, shape, hue, color, and quality of the crystals. The common descriptions of
  Magecite and their crystals can be found here

**Finding Crystals.** Along your adventures in Pelagia, you will wield Crystals and the
  magic contained within, as well as face off against other Elementalists and creatures
  in the world who are wielding the magic of these crystals.

**Using Crystals:** Each crystal contains a power within it that can be expended at will
  as an action. You can attune Crystals to various items to enhance the power of those
  items‚Äô effects as well.

**Recharging Crystals:** At certain points in your adventures you may find different
  ways to recharge your Magecite Crystals. One way is to spend an hour focusing on a
  crystal to recharge it, where you channel enough of your latent magical energy into
  the crystal to give it enough charge to use it‚Äôs power. This can happen on a Short or
  Long Rest.
