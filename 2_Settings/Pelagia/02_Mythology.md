# Mythology

The Gods of Pelagia are mythic forces closely connected to the Elements. All cultures of
Pelagia worship different Gods, and some Gods have been known to interact with Mortals
and ask favors. Some Gods are more removed from society than others, and some enjoy
interacting with the mortal world through their messengers and through boons they
grant. Deciding which diety a character follows (whether granted power through worship
or not), might inform their personality or approach to aspects of the world.

The god you follow and get power from is symbolized by a constellation sign on your
character sheet.
