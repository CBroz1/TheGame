# TC/DR Lookup Tool

By printing the images in this directory, you can make your own DR lookup too. Simply cut around the circles of both the back and inner images and poke a pin through the center. By spinning the inner plate to position the TC at 0, you'll have the upper and lower limits for any DR.
