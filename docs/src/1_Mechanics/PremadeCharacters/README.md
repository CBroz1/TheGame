# Premade Characters

We provide premade character sheets in [this directory](https://github.com/DeckofAdventures/TheGame/tree/main/docs/src/1_Mechanics/PremadeCharacters) for each of the four Roles with levels 1 - 3. 

1. **Caster** Surrey is a learn'ed mage. She's getting on in years and uses magic to 
navigate the world, be it illusion or explosion. Vain to a fault, but some of her
narcissism may be justified.

    - [Level 2](https://github.com/DeckofAdventures/TheGame/raw/main/docs/src/1_Mechanics/PremadeCharacters/Premade_Caster_Level2.png)
    - [Level 3](https://github.com/DeckofAdventures/TheGame/raw/main/docs/src/1_Mechanics/PremadeCharacters/Premade_Caster_Level3.png)

2. **Defender** Thadius is a strength-based brute. He controls the battlefield and has
such a commanding presence that he can drag an enemy through sheer force of will. His
drive for violence could become an issue.

    - [Level 1](https://github.com/DeckofAdventures/TheGame/raw/main/docs/src/1_Mechanics/PremadeCharacters/Premade_Defender_Level1.png)
    - [Level 2](https://github.com/DeckofAdventures/TheGame/raw/main/docs/src/1_Mechanics/PremadeCharacters/Premade_Defender_Level2.png)
    - [Level 3](https://github.com/DeckofAdventures/TheGame/raw/main/docs/src/1_Mechanics/PremadeCharacters/Premade_Defender_Level3.png)

3. **Martial** Sparrow leads with his gut, in an instinctual connection to nature. Their
wolf companion is always by their side, an extension of their senses, and a 
manifestation of their commitment to protect the natural world at all costs.

    - [Level 1](https://github.com/DeckofAdventures/TheGame/raw/main/docs/src/1_Mechanics/PremadeCharacters/Premade_Martial_Level1.png)
    - [Level 2](https://github.com/DeckofAdventures/TheGame/raw/main/docs/src/1_Mechanics/PremadeCharacters/Premade_Martial_Level2.png)
    - [Level 3](https://github.com/DeckofAdventures/TheGame/raw/main/docs/src/1_Mechanics/PremadeCharacters/Premade_Martial_Level3.png)

4. **Support** Jude is a kind, intuitive soul who would prefer to heal wounds rather 
than cause them. Their connection to an otherworldly diety brings magic to aid allies. 
Living among humans as an android has cultivated her drive for pacifism.

    - [Level 1](https://github.com/DeckofAdventures/TheGame/raw/main/docs/src/1_Mechanics/PremadeCharacters/Premade_Support_Level1.png)
    - [Level 2](https://github.com/DeckofAdventures/TheGame/raw/main/docs/src/1_Mechanics/PremadeCharacters/Premade_Support_Level2.png)
    - [Level 3](https://github.com/DeckofAdventures/TheGame/raw/main/docs/src/1_Mechanics/PremadeCharacters/Premade_Support_Level3.png)
