# Introduction

> You’ve entered the world of Pelagia as a player, and realized you wanted to become a
Storyteller, one of the most important parts of Pelagia. This is how our voices spread
through the heavens. Once known as “Beedle Bards,” Storytellers have taken shape all
throughout the known Cosmiverse.
> Respected and honored, Storytellers are welcome at every hearth and home, every tavern
and table, for the joyful company they bring. They tell of adventures, and entertain
those around them by allowing them to live, for a time, within those adventures.
Storytellers are known wide and far for their ability, some even call it Magic, to weave
a story between multiple listeners and spectators and for them to feel they have lived
those adventures for themselves.
> This is the magic you might wield, oh reader. Guides may lie ahead, but the true spirit
must come from deep within you.

> Humbly,
> Duke Beedle of Pelagia

As the Game Master, your task is to bring together a group of adventurers and guide them
through a Story of Pelagia. You can bring together close friends in person, or find new
friends Virtually through ExampleWebsite.com or in the Discord.

If you’ve been a Game Master elsewhere and are hoping to learn about what’s different
about being a Game Master of Pelagia, you can skip right to Section 3, “What it’s all
about”. For everyone else, or those Game Masters who want a refresher, we’ll dive into
what being a Game Master is all about in Section 2: “Getting Started”. If you or your
players ever have questions or need a helping hand, never be afraid to reach out to the
team on Discord `LINK NEEDED` or via GitHub issues.

### Successes and Failures

- Critical Successes have a 1.9% chance of success. They should feel amazing. Make an 
  effort to rewards these exact matches whenever you can.
- Major Successes have a 7.7% chance of success. This should still feel pretty good to
  your players. 
- Successes.
- Misses.

### Likelihood Chart

The chart below shows probability of success for the kinds of draws you will typically
encounter at each DR. Note that Color or Suit match divide the likelihood by 2 and 4
respectively. The final row notes the difference caused by drawing 2 cards at Upper or
Lower Hand. At the ends, there isn't much of an impact, but can increase or decrease
the probability by as much as 25% for a DR 3 check.

| DR          | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6    |
|------------:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:| :---:|
| Normal Draw | 8%  | 23% | 38% | 54% | 69% | 85% | 100% |
| Color Draw  | 4%  | 12% | 19% | 27% | 35% | 42% | 50%  |
| Suit Draw   | 2%  | 6%  | 10% | 13% | 17% | 21% | 25%  |
| Lower Hand 2| 1%  | 5%  | 15% | 29% | 48% | 72% | 100% |
| Upper Hand 2| 15% | 41% | 62% | 79% | 91% | 98% | 100% |
| Difference  |  7% | 18% | 24% | 25% | 21% | 13% | NA   |

### Fate Cards

It's up to you to decide how often you want players to use their Fate Cards. By default
players start with their 2 Jokers and will randomly be rewarded with their Aces. If you
want to give them more chances to redraw, reward key moments of play. This can be a 
great tool for encouraging great roleplay or working together. 

### Skills breakdown

Players will want to make checks based on their strengths. Their approach to a situation
should determine the nature of a check, but the GM has the ultimate say in which skill
applies. Attributes are more responsive/reactive, often for Contested Checks. 
Skills are more active for character-initiated events.

- AGL Agility: Unarmored AC, dodging
   - Finesse: Primary Skill for Martial
   - Stealth: how gracefully you can move about
- CON Conviction: resistance to harmful effects
   - Bluffing: how convincing you are, lying or truthful
   - Performance: success for activities in front of large audiences
- GUT Intuition: Inexplicable gut feelings (e.g., truthfulness, supernatural knowledge)
   - Detection: observing the world passively, taking in the surroundings
   - Craft: Primary Skill for Support, practicing a trade (Medicine, Pottery, Piety)
- INT Intelligence: Thinking on the fly, rapidly recalling information
   - Knowledge: Primary Skill for Casters, how much you know 
   - Investigation: Actively answering a specific question with searching
- STR Strength: Resisting a push.
