# TC/DR Lookup Tool

By printing the images the in 
[this directory](https://github.com/DeckofAdventures/TheGame/tree/main/docs/src/1_Mechanics/Circlular_TC-DR_Tool)
, you can make your own DR lookup tool. Simply cut around the circles of both the back
  and inner images and poke a pin through the center. By spinning the inner plate to
  position the TC at 0, you'll have the upper and lower limits for any DR.
